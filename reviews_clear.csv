rt^review
plus^Everything was great. I was really happy staying here. We got locked out of our room at one point because the online extended checkout did not sync with the front desk, but the front desk handled the situation really wall and got it resolved. I don't expect perfection when I stay somewhere (with 5000 rooms!). The willingness and professionalism in which an establishment is able to resolve issues makes the difference between a good establishment and a great one! The staff did great!
minus^I'm interested to see what the construction in the pool area results in. I wish Casinos were non-smoking areas. Starbucks in the hotel charging $5 for a can of espresso vs. $1.99 elsewhere is pretty crazy. I don't mind paying a premium in the hotel, just not a 250% one. Other than than everything was excellent.
plus^Location was good. Really good air conditioning.
minus^Room wasn’t clean. I found hair in the bed and bathroom. The carpet wasn’t vacuumed. The toilet was on the edge of breaking from the ground.
plus^Room was beautifully decorated and over all hotel decor was exceptional. Lots to do and every taste is catered for. The housekeeping attendants were super nice and accommodating. The food court was good for a quick bite to eat in the evenings after a show and the on site monorail station was very good.
minus^The $400 hold they put on my card put pressure on me as I had a set budget for each day and I was unaware that this would be the case, I would have given it to them in cash so I would have it again apon checking out, but now I won’t have it for a couple of days after I arrive home and this took a lot of the goodness out of the holiday as it put pressure on me for funds on the journey home. The other thing I wasn’t a fan of and obviously this can’t be changed but the sheer size of the hotel and it being at the start of the strip, it’s a long walk to even basic amenities. I would stay closer to the middle of the strip the next time, but the monorail was very useful.
plus^The suite was very nice and spacious. Beds super comfy. The hotel has everything you need and is a great location for access to the strip.
minus^Some of the pool area was being renovated, with so many people there for the event in the conference there was no chance of getting sunbeds. Also the hot water in the tower rooms was not working properly so we got told we had to run the shower for 10 mins until it started working, total inconvenience. Wifi sketchy in some areas, worked best in the room
plus^The rooms are extremely spacious, and the location is amazing. Big comfy beds in the room.
minus^The pools were very small and busy, I can imagine they are massively over crowded during the peak summer times! Was very warm during our time away and we were very disappointed to hear the lazy river is shut until middle of May.
plus^Pool area was great. Also got free entry to Wet Republic
minus^Room was pretty basic. View from room was poor. On arrival the total charges were a lot more than what was quoted on booking.com. The hotel itself is quite dark.
minus^We had no communication with staff besides ordering room service. The room was tiny in comparison to the price paid and other hotels in the area. The pool was over crowded and it was impossible to find a place to sit or swim. The location is ok but towards one end of the strip. 
plus^The staff were friendly and were attentive to our needs. The hotel is nice and clean, there were several pools to use and also, other activities to do while in the pool area.
minus^The rooms were outdated in the West wing location. We stayed at a one bedroom with a king size bed on the 3rd floor. The hallways were narrow with low ceilings, the furnitures and carpet were old and the room smelled like smoke and mold even though it was a non-smoking room. It didn't go well for me with sinus problems and my partner who has asthma. The knobs and the glass doors in the shower were loose. Every time the room beside us would flush their toilet or use their sink we would hear a waterfall sound from the piping of the walls, which would wake us up at night. For the $150 night stay, I could've spent at another hotel closer to the strip with a newly renovated room. Because of the hotel brand, I thought I'd give it a try and was disappointed.
plus^Location
minus^Reception staff was unprofessional and gave unnecessary reasons for overcharging. I was not happy with my check out and they did not ensure I was satisfied.
plus^The rooms were clean and spacious and made up every day with fresh towels  The staff were very friendly  The pool has a great atmosphere and was clean There are plenty places to choose from to eat and drink and live music in one of the bars every day  
minus^There is a really strong smell of cannabis in some of the rooms and some of the public areas  The smokey atmosphere is tough to get used to and due to this the air conditioning left a dusty not great smell in all of the hotel  Some of the decor is a little tired but still a very nice place  
plus^Bed was comfy although queen size in America is smaller than a UK super king. Check in and out staff were very nice and helpful. The ice stations on each floor are a nice touch too. Lots of facilities in the hotel.
minus^The venue is massive and there was no staff after check in to assist with anything as you could never find anyone. Also as a non smoker having to walk past smoking areas to get to your rooms in the West wing was not nice. The windows out of our room was filthy on the outside, you couldn’t see out well it was that bad, although we no view just the other side of the building to see! Also no gluten free options in the food court.
plus^The ventilation in the Casino was good as I have trouble with smokey places.
minus^I was very disappointed the Lazy river was shutdown for service. That was one of the main reasons for choosing the MGM
minus^The hotel was in a good location and relatively clean and pleasant to stay in. Value for money wise it was nice the pool area and fitness centre were great.
plus^The room in the Grand Tower was recently remodeled and really quiet. There were so many things to do on-site.  Great location and easy access to other hotels. Additionally, there were tons of food options at the hotel.
minus^The pool was closed for a private event right as we checked in. That detail should have been disclosed to us in advance. That alone would have potentially made us book at a different property. We were there for a birthday and the main thing the he wanted to do was use the pool. Fortunately, since it is Vegas, we had plenty of options.
plus^Staff were very good in dealing with my problem.
minus^I was locked out of my room without contacting me first.  It took 2 hours to resolve and transfer me to another room.
plus^The casinos that convinced me to play, I liked how the structure and how organized We also saw Elvis. Then there is a monorail stop so it is convenient
minus^I expected a lot more from this hotel as it is one of the most expensive in Las Vegas. Small rooms with zero service, difficulty to go from the Parking lot to the main hall, long list to check in (we were 1 hour in a row! ) escalators not working. I mean, a lot of frustration.
plus^Not a lot very disappointed
minus^Paying triple for my room the what booking.com quoted me and then put us in the smallest room on the first floor with no view and smelled of smoke .. then they got my credit card locked cause there system is not updated
plus^Room was very small and hotel was way too big.  A huge line at check-in after flying all day.
minus^Better check-in and room wasn't what I thought I was getting.  They told us it was an older room and we could upgrade for a cost.  This wasn't clear when I booked the room
plus^Once we arrived at the hotel we were offered a discounted an upgrade to a Stay Well Suite which we happily agreed to. The room was luxurious, two queen sized beds and a strip view plus loads of fancy extras which were aimed for health benefits. The hotel and casino is huge. Multiple restaurants, shops, Starbucks, food court, comedy club and theatre to watch shows. We also managed to get great discount to the show in the hotel just for staying at the MGM Grand on the morning of the show. The seats were great even though the cheapest area of the theatre. The posh Italian restaurant on the way to the pool was brilliant for a splurge meal too.
minus^Be cautious when upgrading rooms as that has its own upgrade tax on it which is separate to the resort tax you already included when booking.  This is probably known for America but travelling from the UK is not something that we usually would have to consider.  Breakfast was not that great compared to other hotels we visited.
plus^Rooms were spacious and spotlessly cleaned every day.
minus^Coffee making facilities in the room although I understand why these are not available in Las Vegas hotels.
plus^Bed was comfortable. Room was spacious. Restaurants excellent.
minus^Initially we were in a standard room in the west wing. The room was horrible. Too small, no bathroom counter space, bad lighting and the shower leaked into the bathroom (where toilet is located). We had to move. Never want to stay in one of those rooms again!
plus^Came specifically to see KA...our choice of where to stay was driven by the fact that KA was at the MGM Grand.
minus^When checking in we had had a long trip and it was late afternoon and we just wanted to get to our room so we asked the clerk to direct us the quickest way to our room.  We discovered after being there, she set us the longest way...through the casino and to elevator that was multiple steps further than necessary.
minus^Construction and difficulty finding front entrance. When we first arrived and needed valet  parking we went around the block 3 times until we found the front entrance. Post more signs to direct people, please.
plus^Room was very comfortable, loads to do in the hotel and the pool area was fantastic.
minus^Having to pay a deposit we weren’t aware of (this should be made clear when booking). 
plus^Why didn't the web site of the mgm group advise potential customers that the lazy pool was not open on Friday 13 April.
minus^Not knowing about the pool Missed out on massage because I didn'know the process until I found it.
plus^Valet parking
minus^I wasn’t happy that there is no hot water for baby formula. I tried to get room service to supply the hot water and was told that I will be charged $14 and have to wait for an hour.
plus^The property was clean and the staff was great except for the front desk clerk when we checked in  
minus^I didn’t like the fact that I’m paying $700.00 for a room in the west wing and didn’t get the option to upgrade until I called the front desk and spoke with Meghan she was very polite and soft spoken she got us moved quickly to the grand tower 
plus^Big rooms and great beds.  Location.
minus^Pool was really busy so we didn't use.  No fridge to use toput our fruit etc inReally strict rules around the one that was in the room that we avoided opening just in case we got charged.
plus^Room was pretty standard, and the whole hotel us huge, if you are looking for that. I think they have everything thar you would not need to leave the hotel itself. 
minus^Navigation around the hotel is a bit hard and clumsy. From reception to your room you have to walk for 5mins at least, including through casino, and long hallways of rooms. 
plus^Comfortable bed, strong and nice shower, but maybe because we were staying on first floor. Staying on first floor means you wouldn't have to wait in line for elevators, and that it's faster to access casinos and other facilities...kind of.
minus^TV in room wasn't working, the door had no use and you can totally here every single person passing by the hallway and their conversation. Almost feels like there's no privacy. We were also given the room on the 1st floor, which the view outside was a cactus near the car park...If you close the window slides I guess it has no difference but again I was a bit shocked. Was disappointed that they gave me a room on the first floor (I used mobile check-in), and the front desk line is always packed with 20-30 people so it's quite hopeless to complain, unless you really have time.
minus^I loved everything about our stay except no microwave or fridge since I didn't use the safe my casino voucher got stolen and the amount I was told when I booked the suite wasn't the price I had to pay way more than expected without adding the deposit.
plus^Plenty of nice pillows, room was clean, staff was very helpful
minus^Check in is terrible but the have a baggage check if you arrive early. Make sure you are able to do the mobile check in, I wasn't aware they offered it until we spent an  hour in line but you have to have a QA reader sent to you. No mini fridge in the room just a mini bar. Pool area is over-crowded.
plus^Everything was great
minus^No hot running water, was able to change to another room which was better then the first room. So I’m very pleased with the ft lady that took care of us.
plus^Great Casino and Hotel.  Room clean and very comfortable.  Online check in / check out available to skip the queues.  Lots of restaurants/ bars throughout Hotel.  Great Buffet. 
minus^No fridge in room.  Lazy river in pool area was closed for renovations.  Allowed to smoke inside hotel.  
minus^This was our first time in Las Vegas and we wanted it to be memorable. We found a well priced room here. Very comfortable bed, clean room, good storage for our luggage. The facilities are amazing! We enjoyed every corner, from the variety of shops to the wide selection of food, the MGM Grand really is true to its name.
plus^Upgraded us on request no fuss. wonderful room, staff brilliant. Facilities fantastic!
minus^Thought some of the restaurants, though lovely were a little overpriced.
plus^The beds and pillows were very comfortable. Valet parking was great.
minus^The foldout bed for the kids was so uncomfortable, it felt like just springs.  Would have liked to have been told that it was an automatic charge minibar before we removed all items to put our kids drinks etc in the fridge. The charges were reversed however.
plus^I have stayed at the MGM many times before and this time they stuck us in a room in the west wing i think it was called. It was not nice at all. i travel 2 times a year to Vegas and this has put me off of staying with MGM. Will stay somewhere else in August.
minus^Our room and one or two of the waitresses in the casino this time were very rude.
plus^Bed was extremely comfy
minus^Hardly any $10 or $15 Paigow tables. Which doesn't make sense and there were 2 tables empty as no one was playing at $25. But the manager at the time stated we could play $10 on the table which we thought was brilliant.
plus^Position on the strip is good and the hotel gives off the Las Vegas vibe. All you need is there and the price for money is good.
minus^Shower in the morning (9-10 AM) was cold (in the evening before it was good). You can see from the finishes in the room why it's not ultra high class (but the price takes it into account compared to a Bellagio or Ceasar's Palace).
plus^Close to the Airport. Good for gambling. Good shows in and nearby the hotel.
minus^Way to expensive. Bad service for 200 bucks per night. After returning one Night at 1 a clock, we thought we have a gas lack in the room. We have asked 3x to fix the problem and they did Nothing a very Long Time. Without offer of room change and no excuses. What a joke!!! Rooms are a bit to old. All in all, never ever again!!!
plus^The beds were comfy
minus^The rooms weren’t cleaned properly.. we were looking for an item... when we looked behind the bed there were garbage from previous guests left there!
plus^Beautiful hotel and perfectly located on the strip.
minus^Need a kettle and tea and coffee so guests can make a cup of coffee or tea in the mornings. Also no bar fridge. Also the taxi driver who picked us up at the hotel entrance to go to the airport overcharged us by force. His name is Goran. Suggest you warn the hotel about this guy
plus^Room was as expected, good size and clean bathroom.
minus^Not happy with the facilities inside the room, there was only a safe. No kettle available and access to the fridge was locked unless we paid $50. We just wanted to store our own water in there but advised this would also cost us?! Other than this it was great.
minus^I loved the location and the way the staff cares fo their customers, i had a problem with the room i eas assigned to md instantly i was upgraded to a superior room.
plus^The MGM had the comfiest bed I’ve ever stayed in. The room was big clean and modern. The hotel was on the main strip, great location. Check in and check out was so easy didn’t have to que once all electronic. We also got a free Uber through MGM. The casino was busy and it was a popular hotel, I would stay here again. Pool is lush,3 big pools.
minus^The room it’s self was noises, which I did expect as it’s vegas, however it was mostly from service lorries, and no eat plugs were provided.
plus^Good overall.
minus^Carpets in the room. No coffee machine. No mini fridge to even put water in. Restaurants and coffee shops in hotel very expensive. Elevators too dark.
plus^The location is great 
minus^Makr sure they give you the room you booked. With a 'false upgrade' they sold as a twin room in a lower category further from the strip! Not cool
plus^Beautiful hotel, room comfortable and spacious
minus^Pool area not large enough for size of hotel, on the weekend there was no possibility of getting a sun bed Had wanted a mini bar in room to use as a fridge and there was a sign stating even moving anything in the fridge would incur a charge which was a bit over the top I felt. Cost of items in the mini bar was a bit much also
minus^I called the front desk and asked for late check out.  They told me there was a fee and I was fine with that.  The problem was, after that the housekeepers came to our room twice and woke us up. I thought that was pretty annoying seeing as we paid for additional time and privacy. Their communication could use some improvement in that area.
plus^Hotel in great location, plenty of great restaurants to choose from! Staff could not have been any more helpful.  Love this hotel stayed now about 7 times!
minus^Can not find any negative points!
plus^The atmosphere was great lots of people around
minus^Crepe restaurant served us breakfast and the meal was missing one of the sides - we went back to ask about it and they didn’t have any they had run out- it was 9am in the morning and they didn’t mention the item was out when we ordered the food
minus^Needed more amenities in the room. A room safe, a fridge, microwave, etc. The Air conditioner never got the room as cold as I would like no matter how long it ran. Also, there is no vent fan in the bathroom and the AC vent did not blow air into the bathroom to help clear out shower steam. Water temperature was warm at best and sometimes barely warm enough to shower.
plus^Parking should be free for hotel guests
minus^The hotel check in staff didn’t pay attention to our special request notes. It was my wife’s birthday and I was looking for a nice decoration in the room that other hotels would do for free.
plus^Very clean and the wait staff at the restaurants were awesome. The rooms were very nice and the beds extremely comfy. Will definitely recommend to others to stay here.
minus^The casino wait staff was rude. Hard to tip a person that gives you attitude.
plus^Food and drink were good.
minus^Our room was less than desirable the awkwardness of two sheets on top of the duvet to act as a cover was uncomfortable and questionable on the cleanliness, there was a soaking wet rag to clean something left on the headboard of the bed the bathroom was dingy, and less clean than a hotel bathroom should be seemed a bit gross. Hallway and room were severely outdated and bathroom space was severely lacking, with zero privacy. Shower floor and walls or grimy and had clearly not physically clean- I wish I had shower shoes for the shower.
plus^Rooms were clean and maintained well. Check out was as easy as pushing a button. Nightclub was really good.
minus^Upgrades and parking prices were different in reality than what was promoted for in booking.com. No variety in restaurants. Not enough staff to help you with directions. Couldn’t figure out how to open the minibar at the room. Had to walk miles for a decent meal. Breakfast line at the restaurant was really really long
plus^It was a good size with lots to do - Casino, Cheque du Soleil, swimming pool and lots of bars and restaurants. It also had a monorail link
minus^The room was dated and dimly lit. It was impersonal. We were on our honeymoon and didn't feel any efforts were made. We also got hit with an unexpected resort fee so be mindful of that when booking. We walked through some of the other hotels and they looked better.
plus^Bed was comfortable. Shower was nice.
minus^The cleaning staff walked in while my husband was showering not knowing we had checked in but it was after 3pm. Small room with a view of what looked like a paved alley/dumpster area. Low hallway ceilings and low lighting made me feel like I was in a basement. Overall, the staff here was not very friendly except for the front desk which I had very little interaction with since I did a mobile check in. Most staff I walked by did not make eye contact or greet you.
minus^Stayed there before and stayed at a better room experience. When this happens You can better prepare and take more, You know or are confident on what to expect. This trip it went down, and for a return trip I felt it should have gone up.
plus^Location of the hotel is good and it is a nice place.  Good spot on the strip, close to a lot of things.  They do treat military pretty well if you register for the Mlife rewards program.  They give an automatic upgrade to pearl and put a logo on your card that people recognize throughout Vegas and it helps get discounts.  The upgrade also gets you free self parking which is really nice to have.
minus^I know it's on the strip and Vegas is an expensive place but everything is just so expensive.  They don't even put a coffee maker in your room, you have to go somewhere to get a cup of coffee and conveniently there are like 8 Starbucks on the ground floor all offering coffee for at least $5.  Even the cheapest hotels put a coffee maker in the room, why not MGM.  We even paid for the upgraded Executive room, no coffee maker.  And you can't even use the mini fridge in the room for your own items, they'll charge a restocking fee even if you don't drink their stuff.  You can get another fridge brought up for your own items, at a cost though.
minus^Awesome! Everything was awesome! Great activities there great food great pool parties and great location !!! Walking distance to a lot of other major hotels and casinos
plus^The people at the hotel was nice.
minus^The people on the phone was very rude, inconsiderate and didn’t show me great customer service. Charged my card for an extra day of stay that I did not use because our flight was delayed because of the weather Trying to dispute it now.
minus^Wow, the walk from the elevator to my room was easily eighth of a mile.  Walking from room to the monorail entrance easily more than half mile.  Not a good hotel for attending a business conference.
plus^The bed was massive and very comfortable.
minus^The resort fees are just ridiculous in Las Vegas, the Wi-Fi was also terrible considering the amount of money you pay.
plus^Location on the strip in Vegas is great!
minus^We were told at check in that we were upgraded to a better room.  Room had 2 queens, we booked a king.  View was of the roof.  Room was small and beds not comfortable.
plus^It was a great location on the strip. Easy access to most places we wanted to visit. It had everything entertainment wise that we needed.
minus^The lighting was awful in our room, with one bulb out. There was a tray of food (room service) in the hallway (in front of the rooms) for all the days of our stay. Housekeeping missed our room. Sink was not draining
plus^Bed was comfortable and cleaning staff great
minus^Didn’t see anyone winning and heard lots of grouchy gamblers in the 2 days we visited. Won’t be to another mgm property sadly. I. Don’t expect to win all the time but I do expect to see any people winning at some point.
minus^We didn’t know a head of time that we are charged a deposit during our stay even when using a credit card.  $100 per night, that was an unexpected expense that i didn’t plan for and completely unnecessary if i was using a credit card
plus^We switched rooms and paid a little more which saved our stay. The room in the Grand Tower was much better
minus^The west wing room was filthy as were the common areas. I was disgusted. I would never consider staying in this part of the hotel. Very poorly maintained.
plus^Clean room...comfy bed and pillows.
minus^The lazy river was under construction. MGMs website said it....,embedded in it. On the second day (our only full day)  there was an event at the pool....meaning only 1 of the 4 pools open.  Booking.com didn’t tell us about the lazy river construction. I may have booked another hotel if I knew.
plus^I loved the hotel. Big and so much to do. Great place to stay.
minus^The room was nice but certain things were just worn down and not in good shape. The faucet had a broken handle, the cabinets were all scruffed up, the shower floor was a bit dirty. Overall, still really good.
plus^Good location and friendly staff. Also great food and pool area.
minus^First room I was given was underground in a bunker without windows. Broken toilet and overall disgusting place. I was shocked that they even send guest to that place. A $50 upgrade per night gave me a much better room. But I feel sorry for people who consent with the bunker for 300 bucks a night. Awful.  + No changing rooms in gym.
plus^The casino is in a great central location and it is easy to walk to the other hotels. The pool was great and there was plenty to do.
minus^The hotel room itself left a lot to be desired - there was no mini fridge, no coffee machine, no door to the bathroom area, a view of gravel -- pretty substandard when compared to other hotel rooms (especially in Vegas). The dining options weren't great (lots of fast food options and then a Michelin star restaurant - not a lot in between). The clerk who helped me check in was pretty rude about using Booking.com, and complained that their system doesn't always update and that it is only $3 less than our website (which was not true) -- when he could have just checked me in using the credit card I had already checked in with.
plus^Convenient location.
minus^Damaged ceiling above shower in bathroom should have been repaired. Hot water is inconsistent and takes a long time to get there. The scent used in the hallway was overpowering and not pleasant. Facility is showing its age.
plus^Variety of foods
minus^Prices were quite high for breakfast. Bathroom sink smelled like sewage. Neighbors in room 407 were extremely loud late night into early morning.
plus^The front desk staff was friendly
minus^Everything was ridiculously overpriced for the quality.  Mostly, I was upset with the lack of customer service.  My keys were never returned to me from the valet( my husband had his and it was a push to start).  By the time I realized that they hadn’t given me my keys back, I called and got the run around from a bunch of people and I am still waiting on confirmation that my keys are being sent to me.  I was made to feel as though it were my fault.
plus^Overall customer services was great from check in to Valet. Although when I asked about our complimentary buffet the check in clerk advised me we didn't receive one when booking.com said we did. So we did not receive our complimentary buffet on our stay. :(
minus^That we didn't receive our complimentary buffet!
plus^Was traveling with friends and reception was able to arrange for adjoining rooms when we checked in.
minus^Smoking is permitted all over the casino and bar areas.  The air quality inside the casino is not very good.
minus^My sheets had rips in them. There was dirty towels on the floor and on the tv stand. The ac wasn't low enough and coundn't change it from 70 degrees or lower. I expected more from MGM.
plus^Although TV was broken it was fixed. I appreciate the upgrade and that hotel provided toothpaste as I had forgotten mine.
minus^Check in queue was long. Someone puked in lobby on my way to my room. TV in room was broken for first night. Kept awake by room next door. The pre-party started as I was going to bed and post was early am.
plus^Bed was comfortable. Location of property was great.
minus^Should have a useable fridge for an option for travellers with kids. Disliked walking through smokey Casino to get into and out of the hotel.
plus^Many restaurants choices.
minus^Slow, dark elevators, and room was noisy at times....groups of noisy men with several rooms, yelling to each other in the Hall ways.
plus^Good food, clean, staff was friendly.
minus^There was no fan in the room or bathroom so after a shower it was so stuffy In there and it never aired out. The hot water sucked, it took 20 min or so to get luke warm more than half of the time. The fridge was a mini fridge that didn’t allow you to store leftovers or you’d have to pay a restocking fee, which is INSANE since we pay so much for food and can’t save ANY of it. No microwave in the room which would have been nice...
plus^I liked the layout of the hotel and the ease of check in.
minus^The room style, the bathroom in our room, the tv/cable froze constantly, we had to call room service 3x to come pick up a room service cart, the security deposit per day was the highest one I’ve ever heard of and it wasn’t clearly outlined in the agreement.
plus^You asked: How was the coffee at MGM Grand? But there was no coffee offered in my hotel room. In addition, I didn't even have a fridge to place my water bottle in. So, my experience at MGM was a bummer for the price I paid for. I didn't have the necessary amenities that should be provided for ALL hotels. Needless to say, I won't be staying here again.
minus^I didn't like fact  that the maid knocked on my door while I was still asleep early in the morning. Not cool.
plus^Close to the T-MOBIL arena.
minus^Sheets were NOT changed in the 4 days stay.  No coffee pot nor coffee in room.  Towels were so worn out, they did NOT absorb the water from the shower.  The TV reception  was poor.  Charged for items not purchased in the room.  Charges were reversed, after a fashion.
plus^The rooms were very private and you couldn’t hear anything.
minus^The staff in the hotel weren’t very friendly but I assume that’s just the atmosphere of Vegas. I’m from the south so everyone is friendly.
plus^The restaurants in close proximity were very good and the hotel offers everything you need.
minus^The towels are scratchy and too small, the iron didn't work, ironing board was broken and the shower diverter only allowed about 50% water flow while the rest filled the slow draining tub.  Hotel key did not work to get out of the garage so had to pay again to get out (whatever happened to free parking in Vegas?).
plus^Clean and big rooms, very good buffet, nice casino, faboulos check in and check out service, perfectly connected with monorail service
minus^a bit confusing inside
plus^Our third time we have stayed here, as always, service, entertainment, food, drinks very good. We have stayed at a number of hotels in Vegas, but my preference is the MGM. Great location on the strip We'll be back
minus^Would still like coffee in the room
minus^It was our anniversary and my sister sent champagne and chocolate covered strawberries and it was perfect!  The staff made it beautiful and everything was delicious!!
plus^Location was good able to get to other places fairly easy they kept the inside and outside clean the security guards were friendly and very helpful  maid service was good and kept the room clean and stocked.
minus^The bathroom counter was way to small the shower and bathroom doors were made of glass and slammed real hard surprised they didn't shatter or break when they closed better and more directory sights would have been nice and having a coffee pot in the room would be nice having to walk through the casino just to get a cup of coffee sucked and the lady in the concierge wasn't very friendly or helpful
plus^coffee was good in grand buffet location was good enough to access strip, public transportation etc.
minus^room condition was not good enough.  TV was not working. not spacious room, a little bit noisy.  shower booth was not sealed enough.
plus^Room very comfy, very clean and big. Lots of options to eat and drinks. Huge casino (a little too big?) and great location, right on the strip.
minus^There is a fridge....  but you cannot use it for your own drinks...  Really???
minus^I was charged over $400 deposit. They explained that they will return money later. I checked from my bank. Money was taken but not turned back later. I already emailed about this to MGM Grand but they didn't reply.
plus^The beds were comfortable
minus^Very very long walk to elevators and room. Lack of hot water, showers leaked, hall smelt very very strong of weed, there was a room service tray that stayed In the hall for 2 days and never moved.
plus^The hotel was in an ideal location on the strip...and massive! Overall, the property was OK for the value we paid.
minus^It was smoky throughout the hotel....in the lobby which was right next to the casino and in our room as well which was supposed to be a non-smoking room on a non-smoking floor. Our room wreaked of smoke throughout are entire stay even after the hotel staff came and sprayed it...There was no seating area in the lobby at all....if you wanted to sit down, you had to do so in the casino itself where the air was stifling!  Also...you had to walk quite a distance to catch an Uber/Lyft in all of the hotels...the taxis were readily available at the front of the hotel.
plus^I like the fact that I won alot of money!!!!
minus^I didn't like the fact that we was in the west wing room 526 and we had to walk soooo back and fourth the whole trip and with all our luggage no accommodation of help at all... And housekeeping only cleaned our room once the whole time... And they have the nerve to charge you $25for late check out.. That ridiculous!!!
plus^The service and staff were great, would have preferred a better view
minus^My window had an advertisement for Tiesto over the window and had a black film over to the window which ruined the view
minus^Resort fee is too high even higher than the other, even I paid for the high resort fee I still need to pay for the parking for $15/per day, most of the hotel provide free parking, I am total disappointed. And the reception help to upgrade the room without telling me and charged me a higher price.
plus^Our room was very nice the bed very comfortable Our room location was facing the airport.
minus^Our room did not get cleaned at all Saturday Feb10th Very disappointed I called the housekeeping manager noting moved I called the front desk They sent us up clean towels only. Also that same evening the security knocked on our door asking us to keep the noise down. It was 10am or later we were preparing for bed on my husband and self. We’re in our sixties. The noise was coming from a room across the hall from us.
plus^The bed and pillows were above excellent!
minus^No coffee pot? Biggest bummer EVER! I shouldn't have to upgrade to a 'better room' in order to have a pot in my room! 👎
plus^I was happy with the room that I finally ended up with - after switching rooms twice due to the fact that they were sub-par and dirty - I loved the room in the main tower with the view - great bathroom and wonderful beds!
minus^I originally had a room booked in the West west wing with a King sized bed - the room was down a hallway that seemed to be miles long - the wallpaper was coming off the walls and it was dark and dingy - I realized at the check-in desk when the lady told me that my room was - well, uh, ok - and that it at least had a nice shower - that I was not going to be happy with this.  I walked down the very long and dark hallway - entered the room - and the room was very dirty - there was hair in the shower and it felt smothering. The phone didn't work either - and I had to use my cellphone - and search for a number  I called the front desk and they offered a beverage cart (so I need to drink to tolerate the room?) and they finally moved me to another floor - this room was very similar to what I had left - and smelled of vomit.  I called again and told them that this was not acceptable - they offered to remove the resort fees - which they did after I had to remind them of at checkout - and they finally moved me to the main tower with a nice view of the mountains and airport - Much better - but the price for the West west wing was very high for the accommodation that they provided.  I cannot imagine having to have slept in those rooms - so for those of you who are thinking that the West west wing is a good idea - don't do it!  There are other great hotels out there.  Not worth the hassle of moving rooms three times to get something that should be standard.  I only stayed because my conference was in the same place
plus^The hotel had all the services that you would expect from this type of venue.  The variety of restaurants was great and there really wasn't any need to even leave the property.  Signage was good.
minus^Coffee makers in the room and access to a small mini fridge would have been nice, especially given the cost of the room and resort fee.
plus^It was close by strips
minus^I was charge for $30 more for upgraded room but the room was not even that great, its small. Wall outlet is too loose when when i tried charging my cell, only 2 outlet that works.
plus^Great Location!  The staff was nice and friendly.
minus^They do not offer free parking like most of the hotels do.  It cost us $12/day.  Our room was really small with no windows.  It was in the West Wing and it was really far from everything else.  I forgot something in my car and it took me over 30 minutes to go to my car and back to the room.
plus^Very good location on the Strip and good price deal for an 8-stay using Booking.com. Clean rooms, comfy bed and helpfull staff. Fast check in and check out. Even I had paid for a Run of house room I got a nice remodelled room since mine was not ready yet by the time of arrival.
minus^Buffets and reataurants might seem to be a bit pricy but this is Vegas. Vending junk food machine on my floor was 80% empty and was not refilled for my whole stay which was more than a week.
minus^The MGM is an opulence that really needs to be experienced to believe. Our room was amazing and provided the perfect amount of space and glamour for a perfect stay. The hotel itself feels like a whole different world with a complete food court, restaurants, nightclub, shops and of course casino, meaning we didn’t even have the need to go outside for the first 48 hours of our stay! We loved being on the strip and will definitely return to the MGM.
plus^generally it was ok, there was a member of staff at the lobby bar that was so ridiculously rude and difficult with us.
minus^the general clientele at the hotel, very rough
plus^Check in and out was super fast. The bed was extra comfy and the room smelt lovely.
minus^The toilet didn't flush properly. The bath was very shallow and not particularly clean, mainly because most people must only use it to shower due to its depth.
plus^The MGM grand has one restaurant choice unless you want to pay 32.00 for the buffett or eat fast food.  The Pub was the only place where the food was reasonably priced and good.  Be careful of the policy of MGM front desk charging you (without notice) an additional 200.00 deposit for the room if you make any small purchase and charge it to the room - they will put through another 200.00 charge in addition to the initial 200.00 deposit that they put on when you check in.  I understand the first one but the second with notice was not ok with me.  If they were going to do that they should have let you know when you check in.  They did not.  The casino's were absolutely smoke infested and the venting system in horrible.  I wouldn't stay here again.  They charge 15.00 for a medium bottle of smart water.  (the 150.00 size at the store)  This kind of intentional gouging leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
minus^The Smoke filled casino.  The high price of buffett.  21.95 for breakfast - approx 39.00 for lunch or dinner!  The surprise charge on your card of a second 200.00 deposit.  The line ups to check in and out.  Too crowded for me.  I'll stay elsewhere next time.
plus^Everything you want is inside the hotel itself and sometimes you just font need to get out.
minus^The rooms are too far from the elevators . And because the hotel is too big It took me 7 to 8 minute to go from my room to the main street. 
minus^I picked up an item from the mini bar to read the label & it charged my card. That was a huge inconvenience being that I never purchase from the mini bar.
plus^Bed were comfortable and pillows also
minus^Room was not clean for 2nights,  the sheets were never change!!!!!!! And the television never worked!!!! The buffet was boring
plus^old but still nice and clean hotel. room very clean.
minus^they know we are Asian so they put us in a very far location room....very far from the elevator. view from the room to outside....not so nice...but okay lah
plus^Jacuzzi suite was fabulous for two nights. Was there to celebrate some good news on the home front and did so. Erotic kit in the room came in extra handy if you follow me. The hookers working the place from 17.00 onward also CAN be a bonus.
minus^Being 86'd from the place because...get this...I got too friendly, too often, with certain ladies at the pool. This was in the week or two after my stay, during which I paid the $10 - $30 daily fee to obtain a cabana bed at said pool.  Turns out a white guy like me talking to people of color attracts too much negative attention. And so I was barred from re-entering on pain of trespass...because several women complained about me. But guess what: the ones they referred to actually DID NOT complain about me, rather, they answered in the negative when questioned about my harrassing them.  I believe either some white (like, Nebraska white...like, I-fear-anyone-I-don't-see-at-my-church white) ladies complained about my focussing on non-white ladies at the pool, or the MGM just doesn't like guys like me dropping $600 for a couple of nights and then hanging around afterwards...making friends? Not really sure. Doesn't really matter. There are PLENTY of other hotels and casinos in town. However, I've not seen many as well-served by ladies of the evening, if you follow me. That's what I miss most about the MGM: me going in and chasing off pimps at 4 AM. This fine city's working girls don't need those parasites. One of my missions is to drive them off. Ah well.
minus^I have stayed here 3 times in last 10 years. I recommend it many times because Of location and pools. Not sure I will do that anymore. The prices have become ridiculous. Sadly , you can’t stay here anymore without paying $45 for a bucket of beer and $5 for apple juice. We went to many casinos during our stay and prices were much more reasonable. Sad how greedy people get because “they can” and people buy into it because you don’t have a choice. But remember, we do have a choice and that will be the last time I recommend MGM to friends and family
plus^This hotel is in a fantastic location
minus^Our room was filthy with dried vomit on the toilet, wet patches on the carpet and even bench and table surface was dirty. If it wasnt for the made beds we would have assumed the room hadn't been cleaned since the last person. Also there was a party going on next door with no soundproofing due to the adjoining door between our room and theirs. When we finally called to complain at 6am (started at 1am) nothing happened.  We were moved to another floor and a clean room which we appreciated but we had to put up the dirty room we started with until 2 the next day. Nobody saw for to even clean the toilet or wipe the surfaces in the mean time. If you choose to stsy here avoid the 4th floor. The other thing that stood out was that every other casino and hotel we walked through to explore all smelled fresh and clean, in spite of the fact tjere were people smoking in thrm. The mgm smelled smokey and gross the whole time. We would not return.
minus^There is no coffee machine in the room, the shower was not strong. Also, I was celebrating my anniversary with my husband in the hotel. We mentioned that to the receptionist when she asked us if we were there for a special occasion and she didn’t even try to make us feel that this day is special. I would expect more from MGM.
plus^Nice Gym Spa Facility
minus^Hotel was dirty and in need of an update desperately. Had to move rooms, once moved room HVAC unit broke took 30 hours to get fixed. Hidden fees 35/night resort fee had I known that I would have never stayed here and gone to a better hotel for what ended up being the same price.
minus^- Facilities are out of maintenance, such as locker, socket, air conditions... - Most dirty hotel I have ever experienced in Hyatt Group. Would you pls check and clean the fins in air condition, which surprised me a lot...
plus^We were on our honeymoon and MGM grand upgraded us so we can experience the hotel to the fullest and enjoy both our celebrations and being first timers in Las vegas. Thank you also for sending us the welcoming package!
minus^When we got to the room, there was a ball of hair in the shower.
plus^Nice hotel, very close to stores. Hotel has a lot of good food areas inside hotel. Room was nice, clean and bed was comfy. Friendly staff. 
minus^So many entrances and exits and different ways to get to the room. I’ve stayed at a few other Vegas hotels and usually find my way easily, got lost a few times. Still would recommend staying here and would stay again. 
plus^The staff in the hallways were very kind and greeted us when they saw us. I liked the location and pool. 
minus^The lady who checked us in wasn't accommodating at all. She didn't answer any if our questions. She just wanted to rush us and move on to the next person. We waited like anyone else. And then we had to ask her for a map and directions to our room when she could have offered that info. Also the room was so dusty. My poor husband's allergies were acting up our entire stay. Under the tv and under the bed were horrible! I dropped my phone on the floor and picked it up covered in dust! 
plus^1. Super comfortable bed! 2. Fairly close to the airport 3. Nice facility
minus^1. Room was not fully cleaned so that we had to switch the room 2. Ka Show was canceled; gave a notice less than 24 hours without giving any reason. Further customer care was not sufficient 3. Was not able to empty the mini bar 4. No coffee pot 5. No airport shuttle
plus^Plenty to do. Rooms spacious enough
minus^They charged me twice at check in so funds tied up for a week.  Reported issue with bathroom each day and it was never attended to.  Rooms need more lighting.
plus^Location on the Strip
minus^We were extremely far from the elevator.   Also, for $378 for one night, soap and a shower cap should have been placed in the shower. 
plus^Nothing......
minus^The hotel is very tired and needs to be updated.  When we went to checked in they only had us checked in for 3 x nights instead of 4 that we had booked and had confirmed by booking.com. The room we were given in the West Wing was miles away from the lifts and was so horrible we had to change rooms and upgrade ourselves to a grand king at an extra $20 per night. The rooms are not very sound proof, we had a rather loud American lady staying in the room next door that would be up at 0700 and start talking, laughing and screaming to her friends on the phone......a couple of times we had to ask her politely to keep the noise down as we were trying to sleep....she ignored us!!
plus^Price is very reasonable for such Star type
minus^Too many people around the hotel lift lobby, no complementary water, slippers and toothbrush is available (may be it is typical in US)
plus^Comfy bed
minus^Bed was stained with blood, lights didn't all work, paper thin walls, neighbours door squeaks loudly every time they open it. Looks like they modernized the rooms, but did a sloppy job. This is a cheap hotel compared to others on the strip, but very expensive when you think l of the quality of the amenities
minus^They charge you with things you don't take from the refrigerator .. they take extra money from you credit card and it has been 10 working day nothing had return
plus^Good location on the strip. Nice friendly staff.
minus^Dated building. Rooms are small and outdated. View from room was of a parking garage. No Starbucks in lobby-only mgm coffee place with very limited selection. Sketchy guests. MGM has gone downhill in the past few years.
minus^Upgraded room when we arrived to get the $10 a day for the spa and upgraded features. When we went in the room, I couldn't really tell what has been upgraded and I feel like it was a waist of money. When arrived at the spa (we went 3 times) they were giving us a hard time trying to charge us full price. Definitely not satisfied.
plus^Food was good.
minus^Three room changes due to somebody overstaying their check out and being in our room along with the hot water not working in the next two rooms.
plus^Loved the location!
minus^I reserved a King Bed, but I swear the bed that I was given was a Queen. It was no where near the size of my King bed that I have at home. The staff insisted that it was a King, so I went along with what they said.
plus^Sportsbook !!
minus^Did not have 15 minutes to wait for shower water to warm up !! Sink plug did not work !! The 25 dollar charge to have a king sized bed which is what we originally booked topped off the whole experience !! I will not recommend MGM to my friends ...
plus^The location is ideal. Hakkasan was a dope club although the drinks were pricey. I guess i can’t complain about that when it was free to get in
minus^I stayed in the west wing room 510 on the 3rd floor. It was not upgraded. i didn’t get good phone service in bc the room is like in a dungeon in the west wing far from everything. I had to move rooms bc the first rooms bathroom was dirty. Then the shower wasn’t working in the 2nd room so i had to take a bird bath before going out
plus^Facilities were excellent, rooms were very big.
minus^I found one or 2 of the staff at the bell desk area seemed very rude until they saw a tip in your hand then the attitude changed to more of a friendly customer service one.
plus^Entertainment's were all downstairs near the lobby
minus^It was really hard to find foods and gift shop because it was around the back of the lobby. Need to have visual maps display board in the hall ways.
minus^The refrigerator was lock needed a pin code to open it. No microwave. No TV guide not sound proof could neighbors. Tub would clog up had to push down the button so it can drain out water
plus^On the strip with a lot of options of activities in house
minus^No coffee in your room, the check in was problematic, additional charge for using the fridge in the room
plus^The young lady that checked us in was awesome and the buffet was great.
minus^My room was super dusty. When you sit on the couch it’s like a dust storm. The water took 20 minutes to get hot each time we wanted to shower. When we check out you guys tried to charge us for alcohol we never drank. That’s very unprofessional. My experience there wasn’t great.
plus^From Check in team,Very helpful staff and pro customer service specially miss Bella,
minus^We are not happy on one thing is No, coffee maker and no microwave in room.
plus^The bed was great and all 4 pillow were king size! I LOVED the fact that the toilet and shower were closed off by a door, that made getting ready SO much easier with two ladies. At first I was a little worried about the size of our room and the fact that it was all the way at the end of a very long hallway, but we found the back elevators and that made such a difference!
minus^The brunch could have been better, everything was super salty.
plus^I have nothing
minus^I paid for an upgraded newly remodeled room with upgraded view.  The TV was broken.  I called and the desk said someone was on their way.  No response.  I called again and asked to be moved.  They moved me.  New room had a broken nightstand lamp and broken clock.  The lamps that did work were difficult to turn on and off as the switch was way up in the lampshade.  My new view which I paid an upgrade fee for was overlooking a parking lot.  At checkout, I wasn't asked how my stay was.  The desk assistant handed me the bill and said thank you.  I didn't respond as I was a little aggravated.  As I was walking off, I heard her say have a nice day in a snarky way and laugh.  That didn't help my experience.
plus^Staff was professional, but didn't get issues resolved. Location is fine.
minus^Property overall is super-dated and time for a significant upgrade. If you want to charge close to Aria, Cosmo, Venetian and Wynn rates - you've got to step up your game big time. I know MGM has a ton of properties, but due to its massive size; the MGM Grand is supposed to be a sort of one size fits all. You can have your budget tourists and business clients, high rollers and higher spend folks who don't mind paying for luxury, but actually get it. I just didn't see that there and have stayed at all the major props over the last decade. Personally, I will go back to Aria and use that as home base again. It just exudes a higher level of clientele, without trying to come across as upper-crust and obnoxious as Wynn. My two cents anyway.
plus^There was everything in this hotel and location was good also. Bed was good too.
minus^West wing wasnt that good. Now it feels like your going back in time and it look outdated and need fixing.
plus^The room was in a perfect location. I walked to pretty much everywhere. Staff was courteous and room was nice. Lots of food options.
minus^The buffet was overpriced for what looks like pretty simple food.
plus^Location
minus^The rooms for so far from the elevators it took a good 5 -7 minute walk to get there and in heels it was brutal.        Someone was puking in front of my door for 2 hours at 2:00am and he paramedics and security were all there, yet didn’t move them to the hospital or to another area, just let them kept puking, and they were all talking loud, super fun to listen to when your trying to sleep.
plus^Checking process was super-efficient. The best checking experience I have ever had. I received an e-mail allowing me to check in even before I reach the hotel. When checked in, hotel will send you a second mail to confirm that the room is ready. You simply need to go the counter and scan your ID, so you have the room key in hand. As simple as that. However, the key dispenser can not read passports. But nothing to worry. A staff is always available to help you. I did not see any checking in take more then 5 minutes.
minus^First of all, I need to say that it may be due to the room choice I made. I looked for the best rate and was allocated a room on the west wing which a quiet a distance to walk from the lobby, casino floor and restaurants. I was offered a room in the Grand Tower at an additional charge of US$ 20 per night. Later thought I should have taken it up. If you do not intend been quiet a distance from the main area of the hotel, it will be good to book in the Grand Tower.
plus^Staff was very helpful. Proximity to the strip was good. There were many easy checkout options.
minus^I spent 2 hours connecting to the WiFi on my phone when I was able to connect on my tablet with the same info in a minute. Two nights in while straightening my bed I found two lipstick (I hope). One was on the sheets and another on the pillow case. The faucet handle for the sink came loose. Each time I showered there would be a puddle on the floor outside the shower.
plus^Buffet was too expense for a regular size meal and your not having beer or wine . You final sit down and find you have to get you own coffee . The food was large in variety but some was dry from settling open, the deserts had cracks in the tart yogurt from settling  .... three people the next day having only eggs or pancakes with sausage/ bacon should not pay $100 When you need to go get you coffee and go back 2x to have you cup filled up again. Than when you decide you go to the food court, the walk is way the hell down on another area .  I paid an up grade for my two rooms a wonder if that was an up grade with a big window looking at a rooftop glaring with flood lights.... want  kind of rooms did we have before??
minus^? What did I like?
plus^The bed is good and the pillows
minus^We didn’t use the pool coz it’s too far from the hotel ,so noisy we can hear the people in the hallway, the faucet is  to slow.
plus^I like everything about the stay I enjoy it.
minus^I didn’t like that there was no hot water when I was taking a shower. I could of call front desk about it but didn’t want to bother them with the small issue.
plus^Staff in all areas were very friendly and helpful.
minus^There were no marked no smoking areas in the casino.........all places should have both smoking and no smoking areas to accommodate all patrons.
plus^The bed was very comfy, pillows nice however I would have liked an extra blanket for weight.
minus^I was located in the West wing...I believe the not yet redecorated room.  There is NO coffee pot, no microwave, and no refrigerator in the room I was given.  Shower and no tub.  The entrance into the room totally exposes the shower room even though the shower and toilet itself was behind frosted glass.
minus^I was very disappointed in the overall stay .... you think with a name like MGM grand the resort would be exceptional and it definitely fell short of that expectation.
plus^Plenty of seat available for gambling and its right on thw strip.
minus^Its was hard to get a drink while gambling. Also the cost for fast food within the resort is way too much.
plus^I got my resort fees back due to a issue with my room
minus^Bathroom had moled in it looked disgusting and when they changed my room it had less then a view was staring at construction at least they could have upgraded to a view for the moldy bathroom that was a major health issue
minus^The room was very good. The check in/our process was great. We used the concierge series too and got into a restaurant we had trouble booking and a show with limited tickets left. Great service. The hotel is also close to shops, restaurants and has a monorail station for getting to other venues on the strip.
plus^The free upgrade after calling to complain that our water was shut off.
minus^West Wing room was outdated and poor. There was no running water. Apparently there was an emergency shut off on that floor. It was disgusting.
plus^The fornt desk girl ONLY when check-in. Attedant at the check-out A WHOLE OTHER STORY.
minus^I booked a two bedroom room but unfortutately the booking was weong and so had to upgrade because the room offered by  booking was in the old and non remodeled side and the front desk upgrade at ADDITIONAL price.
plus^Beds were nice
minus^Dingy carpet, leaking sink,loud construction noise (backup alarm from some vehicle) during night that went on for a while.Difficult to get to some rooms from self park.
plus^Good Wifi-connection. Casino-atmosphere in the Hotel.
minus^Had very high expectatiins for this hotel. Carpets were worn and rooms were small. My colleagues had booked Hotels from well known brands and had additional large suites for even slightly less money. Did not receive room on upper floors of the building as originally requested. David Copperfield was a desater. He does not do any of the tricks as even seen on the advertising trailer but only does a few tricks directly with the audience - very disappointing. I love Vegas and obviously Vegas is known to be the place where you leave your money but this stay felt like a bit of a rip off.
plus^Very large spacious clean rooms with an awesome breakfast (ordered in the room one day) Great facilities in the lobby  One of the best clubs in town inside the MGM (Hakasan)
minus^Room service takes too long Cleaning is slow (table stays outside the room for a day before being taken away) Walls are a little thin at times :)
plus^rooms and beds were comfortable
minus^So many extra fees no coffee in room $25 a day if you want a refrigerator charge for late checkout on line room requests ignored
minus^Upon arrival to our room it looked like someone had used a lotion and a towel. Both were found in the bathroom. Empty shampoo bottle and the lotion bottle was previously open. Seal was broken on the bottle.
plus^It was well situated for the strip 
minus^Smoking in all public places was awful. No ability to make a cup of coffee and you get charged excessively for everything. Only for those hooked on gambling.
plus^Actually it is a short stay here, but everything is so good. MGM Grand would be a good choice if you come to Las Vegas!
minus^I ordered two rooms together on booking, but when I came the staff said the two rooms were in different towers. AND I need to spend more money for that in order the two rooms can be next door. This is the only experience I am not satisfied with.
plus^Nothing impressive other than the location
minus^Where should I start? The check in process took forever. They charges people so many fees to the point where it starts to het very irritating. I was not a big fan of the dated furniture. Room service was mediocre. 
minus^The room was number 540 and when you get out of the elevator the first number was 401 and i had to walk almost a mile every time i wanted to go in. Or out of the room .  Bed sheets weren’t clean , and towls as well ,  Such a disappointment .
plus^It's a good hotel for the price. Do not expect Four Seasons accommodations, but do expect a spacious, clean room that is located inside a typical mega hotel on the strip. We didn't experience any loud noises or partying which was nice. The hotel grounds also has anything you need for your stay. Also a short 10 minute drive to the airport (it's on that end of the strip which makes arriving/departing easy).
minus^N/A
plus^Nothing it was the biggest disappointment ever.  Value for money was shocking.
minus^They 1st asked us when we got there late at night if we wanted an upgrade for an extra $75.  We took the upgrade.  Well if that room was an upgrade I would hate to think what we actually booked.  The room was facing the noisy air conditioning units on the roof. They moved us the next day to one higher up. The room was still shabby (needs an URGENT upgrade).  We were there to get married.  The hotel has no customer service at all.  You are just a number in their money making business. For South African this was a very expensive trip because our currency is 14 to the dollar.
plus^Location is very good  Very entertained place to stay
minus^The pillow is too high The room is a bit old  There are stains on the walls  No fridge in the room (we stayed on the 6th floor at west wing )
plus^Staff was very friendly and cooperative. Rooms are beautiful and comfortable.
minus^The parking fee of $20 night was ridiculous. Way too much ☹️ Then on top of that you have to tip the staff forgetting and returning your car. It’s not their fault it’s the hotels. Then you pain spy fees on top of your rooms. Parking was a nightmare everybody around me was complaining.  And then the attendance where the real victims because they weren’t getting tipped. Not good.
plus^Efficient check in and out, central location and good car parking. Entertainment was good at losers bar.
minus^Room was tired, small dark and expensive. No natural day light and room backed onto a service area full of discarded furniture and fittings. So if you lifted the curtains it was dismal. We paid for a king suite thinking room would be bigger but it was tiny.
minus^My 5th time in Vegas, one of stays I would not recommend. Very slow service when asked in hotel and not mention that as a guest of a hotel you don't have any better treatment for venues and places which are part of the hotel such as restaurant and clubs.
plus^I like the view.
minus^I don’t like my room because it doesn’t   have a coffee makeer and the fridge is full whit stuff I don’t like and I can’t used the fridge and the stuff in the fridge is very expensive.
minus^Tub wasnt working properly. They did send their engineer up but the tub was still slow draining. Had to keep turning the shower off to let the water drain. AC wasnt functuoning properly as well. Even with AC on it would blow hot air. Didnt want to keep calling so just had to suck it up since we were only there for 2 days and was out most of the time.
plus^Good location on the strip. Staff are friendly if tipped
minus^Room was old and quite small. West wing is about 10min walk to the casino downstairs. Air conditioning duct was full of dust. Walls are also paper thin so don't book the west wing rooms if you plan on getting any sleep during your stay as we could hear people making noise all night. 
plus^Conveniently located on the strip.  New bathroom - unfortunately not clean
minus^West wing is old and shabby. Carpets and walls dirty. Furniture from the 80s is damaged. Room very small with no natural light. Loud humming sound coming from outside fan/AC. Would recommend paying a little extra to stay in the newer renovated wing.
plus^A lot of facilities easily accessible.
minus^Messed up charges for things that had already been paid for. Lack of transparency in charges. Staff in some areas rude.
minus^Can't imagine, how's a guest can drive in to the hotel and you guys are still charging parking. We had stayed on other hotels before and haven't pay for parking. I don't think it's fair  !
plus^There is subway outside the hotel and only $5 each time for going to other hotels, so it's pretty convenient. MGM has a lot of entertaiment facilities. Check in and check out process is automated so it doesn't take much time waiting in line.
minus^Not provided toothbrush
plus^Structure, room, cleanliness, view from the room 14th floor
minus^Staffs (most of them didn’t look patient and they weren’t very friendly, bottom line: dry).
plus^Good facilities. Good room size. Modern.
minus^Stayed on 12th floor. Issues with no/sporadic hot water the entire stay.  Underwhelmed with quality of buffet meals...plenty of variety but quality of seafood was ordinary at best. Wolfgang Puck restaurant overpriced for meal quality.
minus^horrible cleaning crew, no hot water, leaking showers, stopped up sinks, cleaning crew just walks in the rooms with out waiting for your response even with the do not disturb sign
plus^Helpful staff, overall clean, pool opened for families, gym was nice
minus^Smoke ugg, cigarette butts under dresser. Room lighting not enough and shower pressure poor.
plus^close to monorail, close to other attractions.
minus^long walk from elevator to room.  in room fridge is stocked - too expensive.  Could not use fridge for our beer. had to rent a fridge for $50 per day.  Not good!
plus^Fast checkin.
minus^I was informed at checkin that the room booking was an old room. decided to pay extra for upgrade. I was chaeges for drinks that i dis not drink from fridge.
plus^Room service is excellent as is the staff. Joël Robuchon restaurant in world class.
minus^Not good for kids. Spa facilities only from 18 up which should be clearly informed by the hotel prior to arrival. Noise level very high. General information about breakfast and other dining alternatives not very good. Avoid the so-called Stay Well-rooms. Very uncomfortable beds.
plus^On arrival the checking in process was very quick and easy. I had previously contacted the hotel requesting our rooms to be near each other but we had been allocated rooms on different floors. When I mentioned this to the gentleman he immediately re allocated us onto a different floor and the rooms were an upgrade from what we had booked. There was plenty of choice for eating within and all at different prices to suit all. The beds were very comfortable and the black out blinds were great especially the first couple of nights with adjusting to the time difference.
minus^That due to the size of the hotel the room walls are very thin and if you have noisy neighbours you can hear everything, even to the fact of people walking down the corridor you can hear the full conversations.
plus^Bed was comfortable and rooms very clean
minus^The fact they downgraded our room when we booked a suite and there was nothing we could do but take the standard room, they did however give a price adjustment
plus^Bresha and Amy (the manager)  went out of their way to help me out of my technical dilemma I ended up having. They were SO accommodating and made my stay so much enjoyable!
minus^Room had not been thoroughly cleaned. Found wrapper from previous guest (I guess) still left in the room. Ewwww! After room was supposed to be cleaned when we returned to the room all trash was not disposed of. In fact bag of trash was still on table because it was too big to fit in garbage bin was still sitting on table and didn't look like it had been touched! I was perturbed by that.
plus^The room was clean and comfortable. I was lucky enough to be in the tower close to the check in desk so my room was not too far.
minus^I requested and booked a King room but I was put in a room with two queen beds.
plus^Support from the checkin staff to accomodate the issues we faced while checkin
minus^Miscommunication. We did the mobile checkin and had indicated guest names. Never recieved confirmation and hence our checkin was delayed. Even though I booked 4 rooms, they insisted everyone be available with IDs. Bizzare since reservation was under my name.
plus^Bed was super comfortable. Location is a little on the bad side of the strip, but it is walkable enough to other casinos and hotels. Good brunch.
minus^Room was way smaller than the photos suggested. Casino is older and not well decorated as the other ones.
plus^Everything was amazing from mobile check in to mobile check out, parking the staff at the counter, the huge casino and the number of fantastic restaurants and shopping. There was a speciality shop with original photos, music albums and costumes / accessories from celebrities and movies which was wonderful. It was really expensive for us but visiting the shop itself was a pleasurable experience
minus^Coffee in the room is certainly required when the resort fee and all other add ons are already charged
plus^Food and drink was amazing. Comfort on room was very nice.
minus^So much to be unhappy about. Slammed me with additional fees that no one could explain. Fee removed but experience with Megan was torture. She was Smug, unprofessional, intense, constantly refereed to as “maam!”....never been treated so poorly.  Having mever been to the mgm, i called and asked about parking. Lady recommended parking in parking lot Nd then checking in.   Elevators in parking lot so slow! Were they working? Some escalators were off. Parked on level 4 over a mile from the fron desk toting 100 pounds of luggage and gifts purchased from previous destination. By time i checked in, was grumpy and exhausted. Valet should be recommended for guests with lots of luggage! But another example of poor service was the check in. Was grumpy (i apologize) but the woman who checked me  did not smile and not really friendly or a people person. No attempt to be warm or welcoming despite my complaint about broken down products on parking lot.  Then there was the fiasco new years day where our food took over 48 minutes. Manager did comp 20% of the breakfast because it took so long. Waitor accused me of aharing my cup of coffee withthe other people at the table. Really!?  Yet another example of poor service was inability to resolve small issues quickly. So in the gym there was a guest blasting music from her phone. Called the hotels 800 line to get help but pht into orbit. Ask several employees about a lap pool. Of the theee people, all said they didnt know but dis know 1 pool was open.  So the services really tarnish the grandeur of this place. Looks good, but isnt all that it could be. Met an unhappy couple in the elevator who were complaining about housekeeping.
minus^Room and floor smelled like cigarettes.  But bigger problem was booking. I was essentially charged twice and now I need to contact MGM again to figure out this situation.
plus^Fun dancing at bars. Won $2000!!!
minus^Security told me to go put a bra on! My man wanted me to dress that way. I bent over while dancing & I apparently washanging out. OMG I 'm a Gramma! I'm 61 years old. I felt very disrespected. My man was VERY ANGRY. AGGRESSIVE MALE ANGRY. ONE WHO'D HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK ANGRY. I had to calm him down & non- verbalkybtell the Security guard that he was OK. The night deteriorated from there. We lost $500. My man went to bed crying, hating & blaming himself. Thanks a lot security staff! My man's Birthday is January 1st. He feels sick about this loss of money. He lost everything i. Florida's Hurricane Irma!!!
plus^Room was clean and in good condition.
minus^The casino is a smoke chamber. Heavy smoke makes it very difficult for anyone especially family with children moving across from lobby, concierge and elevators.
plus^The room we stayed in was nice and comfortable.
minus^Lousy self-parking for handicapped people, not enough spaces and too far to go to get into the hotel. Pre-check-in failed and we had to go through a very long line to register. Lots of extra fees, one third of the room rate was a facility fee.
plus^I like the location of the hotel....very perfect👍👍👍 and also all the staff incld the reception are very nice...and i'll be back again soon with all mu lovely family😍😍
minus^Nothing
plus^i loved the staff and how accommodating they were to me and my needs
minus^the hallways had a lingering smell of smoke. if the hotel had a smoke free wing it would have been great
minus^The employees at the lobby seemed annoyed by all the visitors. They answered questions in a very arrogant manner, E.g. regarding the self check-in/check-out..  You have to pay for parking as a hotel guest..
plus^Nice stay, everything you need from gambling, shows, clubs and restaurant is located in the hotel (no need to leave the hotel ) Great fun Super comfortable bed  Fast Wi-fi and large tv selection
minus^Parking is extra and a little walk to the hotel  This hotel is enormous, long walks and easy to get lost  Pool is closed in winter season, which was not labled appropriately
plus^All around good. Shopping. Eating. Casino.
minus^First room we got the A/C was set to 65 and kept blowing hot air to the point it was 87 in the room. Reported it to the staff and they were slow at first but they put me into another room and it was great from there on and the second room had a better view. Very busy location and they are allowed to smoke all over the casino.
plus^Not sure it was just average I did not have a great experience with the room I had.  I upgraded to a king size bed ended up with a view of a parking lot from the 11th floor did not find it to be a lively or a fun place to stay. I know  the concerts are excellent and have attended on previous visits but never stayed here before. The staff was always accommodating and helpful. I stayed 4 nights and should have requested a new room. I am sure the staff  would have accommodated.
minus^The MGM  is dated and my room was just average;  the shower in my room was terrible I also did not care for any of the restaurants It is not located in a greatest spot on the strip  Plenty of other hotels to choose from at or just a bit more for the money.
plus^The availability of mobility scooters for rent and at a great price! Disabled veteran recovering from foot reconstruction surgery, and the walking boot was too much. We were VERY greatful for the use of a mobility scooter.
minus^Nothing. Our trip exceeded our expectations.
minus^When we were checking out, we forgot the room keys in the room. When we asked for another key at the reception at the Mobile check in, one of their staff told us to get in line with the normal check in to get the key. The line was very long. We just asked Help from him to get us a key so that we can use to exit the parking. The staff was very rude and we had to speak to someone else to get the key.
minus^Bartenders at the bars were Rude and the new vouchers are just lame.  We came last Xmas and had a VERy clean room.  This year our room hadn't been cleaned well upon arrival . Didn't even feel like complaining.  Carpets are worn and a bit dingy . Water bottles and sequins from last guest under the table and strewn around floor . Just not a great stay . Still ate at all the restaurants and had good food . (Taps not the case ) we won't be back next Christmas.
minus^The check-in took a long time, the room key which was used to enter parking garage did not work.  The TV needed to be reset.  A number of little problems, but with time all were resolved.  Also not much for children to do in the area. Food on property was very overpriced.
plus^Leaving!
minus^The room has constant dumpster noise that wouldn't allow us to sleep in the mornings! The toilet kept bubbling with water splashing onto the seat every time you flushed!  The restaurant took over an hour to bring plain toast and coffee. Though the most frustrating part is one of my shoe is missing from the room that was there before housekeeping! So I'm leaving with no sleep, horrible service and without my shoe! Worse part was no security entering the elevators! So many strangers would wait till the doors opened and jumped in and it definitely showed they were not guests of the hotel! We only stayed here because the concerts we wanted to go to were held here otherwise for 40 bucks more we could of stayed at cosmopolitan!! Lastly I included a Pic of our so called tower spa suite!!  Simply Ridiculous! Worse experience in Vegas yet!!!
plus^Big room, very clean, efficient check-in and check-out process. On the strip so close to a number of hotels/casinos as well as close to Coke and M&M World etc. Close proximity to the food courts too.
minus^No Breakfast included. Shower tap seemed a little broken, kept popping off.
minus^Room next to us people smoking. Our room flooded with smoke. No room freshener after repeated request. During checkout the staff was rude and appalling
plus^Nothing
minus^Staff were poor, security never came when I called and informed 3 times that next room were smoking and partying and they were 10  in a small room at 4 am
plus^The view from our room was nice.
minus^We were told the room for the week on booking.com was £241.00.  When we got to the hotel, they added a resort fee that came to MORE than the actual room...we paid £600 for the week!  We did room service 1 day and had a £91 BREAKFAST that was overcooked in some parts and undercooked in others.  Also, we were put in a section of the hotel where the rooms were old and outdated.  The bed was also incredibly uncomfortable and the TV barely worked.  I'll never stay at MGM again and we travel to Vegas 2-3 times per year,
minus^No breakfast for the price. Over priced for the basics.Staff are con artists. Instead of staying in a hotel felt like I was staying in a casino where I had to keep a lool out on everything
plus^We ate at the sports bar twice, not because of the games on to but because the service and food was great. Our room was a good size and clean and compared to other places we've stayed at the batheroom and shower was clean and excellent. Staff are always helpful too.
minus^It was a bit confusing to navigate through the mgm. At times all we wanted was the get to the strip outside and the signage wasn't clear. It wasn't until a staff member said follow the T-mobile area name on the sign that we knew how to get from the evevator to the strip.
plus^Location
minus^Too expensive, paid $170 for a night that's already discounted, parking fee not included, no breakfast. Got itch from bedsheet, water drains on the floor outside from shower room...
plus^The cleanliness and employees help since my wife is handicapped.
minus^The work - remodeling being done the first night we were there. Banging all night long. BUT we chose not to change room due to the convenience of location.
plus^Central location to In N Out, plenty of shows and such and the T-Mobile stadium.
minus^Late check out fees for only a few hours were half the price of a full nights stay. Bit absurd.
plus^Good room for the money, dinner at Craftsteak was worth every penny.
minus^No place to sit and relax for a minute without buying something, be it a drink or playing slots.  Guess that’s by design though.
plus^Very comfortable bed!  Nice clean room.  Housekeeping staff was amazing and friendly.
minus^Could smell cigarette smoke in our room even though it was non-smoking.   Screen print over the window ruined what was otherwise a great view!
plus^Friendly staff.  Pool area & gym 
minus^Looks tired and dated when compared to other hotels on the strip. This is most noticeable in the casino.  We were given credit for breakfast rather than a voucher but this has still not been refunded since our stay almost 3 weeks ago. 
plus^Have stayed here before, and was happy.
minus^Nickle and dime you.  pay for resort fees we don't use, and bed was hard as a rock. West wing rooms were not as good as other ones.  but liked location for shuttle for rodeo was good.
plus^No
minus^Pretty pretty dirty!!! smell bad, carpet and air condition are dirty and mould, long and narrow hallway, took a very long walk to room, never go to this hotel, the worst hotel we had in our trip
plus^MGM was convenient to the strip and all the things we wanted to see.  My daughter and I saw the Mike Tyson show at the MGM and it was awesome.  Would love to go again.
minus^The only thing I can think of that I didn’t like was I couldn’t find any Tyson souvenirs and I felt there could have been more Vegas/MGM T-shirt’s.  Or I couldn’t find them??
plus^I liked the location to Las Vegas Strip and I loved that Denny's was in walking distance because the breakfast at MGM is pricey. Staff is friendly and the view was decent.
minus^I was feeling a bit under the weather so I ordered up a mini kettle for boiling water (for my Theraflu and tea). First of all it was $30, which I find totally ridiculous -- there were no microwaves. Anyway, that's fine, but it was dirty when it arrived. See pics.
plus^The room was a decent size and there is a monorail station at the hotel, which was good.
minus^The whole hotel stunk of cigarettes; the air was thick with it as smoking is allowed in the casino. We visited most hotels on the strip and this one was particularly bad. Operating the shower/bath was a bit tricky and we never could stop the bath from dripping when we showered. Also, every time you move something in the fridge it automatically charges you as it’s all weight censored, which sucks if you like to remove items to add your own for a bit.
plus^Restaurants Location
minus^Condition of room - phone didn’t work, weird room layout,  beat-up shower. LONG hallways to get anywhere. Property showing its age. “resort fee” on top of room rate is a joke - shame on them
minus^I feel the room was a little out dated. The shower leaked all over the bathroom floor, because it wasn't sealed right. The bathroom door also didn't close, or have a lock.
plus^Comfortable
minus^Mini Bar $50 restocking fee. I know I'm not suppose to touch the mini bar be wise it's pricey..but I was hungover and didnt want to go all the way downstairs for a bottle of water..
minus^Nice stay, friendly staff, did change my room immediately when loud construction work on the street startet. The room was spacious, clean and very comfortable.
plus^Friendly staff. The room price was good although the Vegas tax on top of the state tax can double the bill.
minus^The window of our room was very dirty which spoilt the view. There was no tea /coffee making facility in the bedroom which was disappointing in a 4 star accommodation. We paid for a room upgrade so this was disappointing.
plus^Awesome staff, awesome room (staywell)
minus^Upon arrival- keys weren't working. Front desk lady was not too reliable and efficicent with giving us the correct room Key. We arrived at 1am- so tired and my toddler is also very tired only to go back and forth the front lobby from the 14th floor because of her carelessness. The front desk should know better to be more precise with her job to avoid these kinds Of inconvenience.
plus^Great facilities with everything you need at the property.
minus^Our stay was good, however a waitress at the Japanese restaurant on our last day was extremely rude and treated my wife and I terriblely, as I believe this was because we were dressed in travelling clothes. We usually eat at higher end places and actually ate here twice during our stay, dressed nicely we were treated great, however she really put a dampener on our stay. Never judge a book by its cover, especially in Legas.
plus^Clean room. Helpful staff
minus^Self check in didn’t work. Had to come back downstairs to activate room keys. Room was too warm. Couldn’t cool it down with thermostat.
plus^I really like the hotel.  had a lovely room on the 26th floor with amazing view. bear in mind that it is a really huge hotel so depending where your room is you might have to walk along a long corridor to get to your room, easy to get lost :-) I like that you can easily get to the nearby New York New York to grab some yummy slice of pizza
minus^you have to pay for a car park. I think it was $19 per night but you have to pay for car park in all other hotels as well on the Las Vegas strip
plus^Always helpful and friendly. Awesome people and cleanings stuff. The people and stuff (from cleaning personal to bar tender to checkin personal) was so wonderful and friendly - they made this stay an awesome experience! Big time THX!!!
minus^Room window was towards a wall.  Room toilet was breaking down twice. Toilet flush handle was not going up by itselfe and had to manually been pulled up each time. Changing the looks was done without previously explanations, that it would be done, when it would be done and that I will need an alternative key. The outside pool got dark at arround 3 o’clock. Would have wishes for a little more time with sunlight.
plus^Good location, big hotel and nice pools. Some of the pools were closed when we got there. I'm guessing we were out of season despite the weather still being nice. The room we were in was an upgrade from a standard room. It had a little living-room area as well as a bedroom part to it in a studio-like room.
minus^We had a room without a view. The bathroom really needs an upgrade. For a hotel that claims to be environmentally responsible and encourages customers to re-use their towels, they really need to fix the fact that it took between 10-15 minutes for the water to warm up before you could comfortably take a shower or bath. The room itself was pretty dated as well. Nothing too special, we just enjoyed the extra space. Some of the hotel stores are a complete rip-off and way overpriced. Better to walk a bit to the strip and get some goodies / food items there. The hotel could only extend our late checkout due to a later flight until noon. This wasn't due to a lack of space in the hotel, but a later checkout was only possible against an additional payment.
minus^Nonstop issues with our keys.  Then maintenance knocked on our door at 9 am to change out the lock. Took them 40 minutes.  Not sure why they can’t do this after checkout at 11.
plus^Location and liveliness
minus^I was staying at the Mandalay Bay the sister property of MGM Grand but was excited to spend my final two nights at the MGM. I thought all year on the last time I stayed and had a really  good time. I had my husband all excited as well bc I had told him about it. What a mistake! The housekeeping staff from supervisor on down was non responsive and lazy. I requested at least 6 times to have the hair from the previous guest cleaned from the tub. They kept telling me to give them 10 min, 15 min etc. I called the front desk and spoke with Raven and several others and they seemed baffled as to why housekeeping would not come. They offered me a spa package for the day but I just wanted a shower. I spoke directly to a supervisor and he  promised to send someone but no one came. I went to the housekeeping room and knocked but no one was there. At that pointed, I just wanted access to the cleaning products so that I could do it myself. We spent a couple hours waiting to shower so we could get on with our day. In the end, I had to request a room change over a dirty tub. On the way to our new room a dirty and wet towel lay in the middle of the hallway. The overall cleanliness is NOT what I remember. I just felt dirty the entire time after all of that!
plus^Resort is huge with every bit of the dazzle that Vegas is famous for. It's at the end of the strip so you can cover everything while walking to other end (Venetian) and back.
minus^No tea/coffee maker in the room. Only room available was on the first floor. Hence was coaxed into upgrading for a higher floor but even that hardly had any great view.
minus^To the mgm November  2nd through November 5th When I checked in I was told I would receive a text message when room was ready. Didn't happen.  Light built into mirror. Horrible! Can't see what you doing because light is directly in eyes!  In the middle of shower completely ran out of hot water! Had to turn water off for 3-5 minutes! Blinds in room didn't lower cuz one side was broken! Although the light in closet was wonderful the rest of the room wasn't lit well so couldn't get full effect of the outfit!  Down in the casino I was at a slot machine for about 45 minutes and not 1 person came over to offer a drink!  Not only would I never stay at the mgm again I would advise against it to anybody I know! Sandi Rhyner
plus^I like that it was right off the strip.
minus^The room was old and had an mildew smell. Everything in the resort was overly priced. We left the resort to eat & shop.
plus^To be honest, I really was not in love with this property, the room, or the location. The only thing I did love was the number of restaurant options inside the hotel as well as its proximity to TopGolf. The Christmas decor they were putting up was very beautiful as well. All in all, if you're not looking to leave the hotel during your stay or seeing a show within the MGM - it's a place for you. (just don't expect any upgrades)
minus^When I checked in I tried to upgrade my room but the hotel concierge but he said there were no complimentary upgrades at this time nor do they exist at the MGM hotel. When I finally get into my room, I planned on taking a nap due to a super early flight, however, just my luck, there's a SCREAMING child next door and banging on the conjoining door between my room and theirs. I call the front desk and ask for a room change and I was informed any other room available I would have to pay additional each night. Finally, after 2 operators, a mlife representative, and 5 hours later... a manager calls me and offers me the same room on the 28th floor with no additional cost. Aldi, (who was wonderful) helped me move my bags upstairs and was so professional and so apologetic about my stay thus far. After unpacking my bag, again, I find old cherry stems beside the bed on the nightstand and a leftover ice bag (filled with leftover water) in the ice container from a previous hotel stay. Nonetheless, I decided to take a shower when I notice 2 of the large towels are stained with huge black splotches. YAY! You can definitely tell there was a tight budget when it came to the upgrades needed, and they just upgraded what they had to instead of making it coordinate. My fiance is a way nicer person than I am, and would not let me complain again to the management staff. We were on a non-smoking floor with a non-smoking room but yet it still smelled like the casino downstairs on our floor and in our room! The wifi is absolutely terrible. Your room does not include robes, coffee pot, iron, or a refrigerator unless you decide to purchase or rent these items during your stay.
plus^We upgraded to a fantastic suite with pool table for a great price.  Fantastic experience and would thoroughly recommend the MGM to anyone travelling to Vegas!
minus^Nothing.
plus^The front desk the guy who helped us was very nice, i had a complaint and he was very nice in bringinh over the manager to get us an upgrade in room.
minus^The rooms are so not private. You can hear everything from the other rooms .
plus^I felt like they wouldn't have known if I was dead or alive. Our room was in the West wing which was miles from the main lobby. Our key didn't work - 3 times to get it re initialised. And still it was our fault! We inconvenienced them.
minus^Impersonal. An imposition to stay there.
plus^We loved the location of the hotel, close to the airport and right on the strip. We got a good deal on the room, and the room was very clean and spacious. Checkout was quick and easy.
minus^There was a queue to check in and queue for the Bell Desk to check our bags. The air and water in the room were so drying. Food and drink were overpriced in the hotel. The smell of smoke in the casino areas was disgusting.
plus^The staff were nice.
minus^I had a no smoking room but the room smelled like smoke. No hot water available when trying to take a shower whether morning or night. Iron would not work. Wifi nonexsistent. For an executive suite I am not impressed. I stayed here twice before in a regular room and was pleased but I spent an enormous amount of money for a suite and I am so not pleased. Not staying here again.
plus^The location is convenient. Near to eateries and restaurants. 
minus^The rooms smell of smoke even though non smoking rooms. The mattress is too soft and pillows are too soft too. There is no electric kettle in the room and rental of electric kettle will be USD30 per day which is ridiculous. We have baby with us and we need hot water to make milk and hot food. The carpet is not cleaned up each day. The shower structure is not children friendly and makes it very difficult to bathe them. There is no space for us to place anything in the fridge at all. Everything in the the fridge is tagged and will be charged of anything is removed even though not consumed. Hope that the management can look into the amenities of the room to make it better. 
plus^Bed comfortable
minus^Too far from the elevator room located on 14th floor , felt like the length of a football field to get there (533).  A bit much for two Seniors to walk.
plus^High quality bed
minus^We booked a StayWell room which is supposed to provide you with a healthier stay based on clean air. It’s just a marketing concept as I found out that the air purifier inside the room was completely clogged with dust, meaning the air filter was never changed, or only very long time ago. There were no humidity adjustment in the room and I felt the air was very dry, as usual in Vegas.  The room vents were not clean neither So, it’s a shame pretending selling better environment! You have to pay for parking when our next door hotel was free, like most of the hotel in Vegas
minus^Booking.com should also offer Disabled rooms. I had entered the request for disabled room in special request which was completely ignored until our arrival to the property. All disabled rooms in the West Wing were allocated and we were provided with regular rooms. My dad (71 years old and paralytic) fell in the room and was on the floor for almost 3 hours until I went to the room in the morning! This could have been avoided if proper attention was taken whilst checking us in..!
plus^Excellent location & friendly staff.
minus^Rooms were not clean. Staff did re clean the room after it was brought to their attention but the bathroom was so poor before hand. 
plus^Vegas is different. A lot of traffic inside and at the front desk. Most of the questions could be answered by online applications on TV etc. That was awesome.
minus^for short questions is a personal contact good to have somewhere onsite.
minus^This property was reasonable in cost. The staff were welcoming. The environment makes me want to come back. It was plenty to do and the food was great.
minus^A BUT money.. l said just pay cash and at hotel...but get deposit &VERY  expensive & 40% resort &FOR pay money every thing...ldont like &no chose for other people.THANKYOU
minus^Valet was a mess...waited for 25 minutes for my car...when I asked why it was taking so long I was told ...sorry, we only have 1 driver today - 7pm at night with a full line of cars and people waiting.   Asked for someone to come set-up our pull-out bed (no one ever came) Asked for someone to bring blankets and pillows (someone came 3 times with blankets) Went to the high-end Italian restaurant in the property for a 8:45pm dinner.  Literally 4 other tables in the place seated.  When we got there - told them our name for the reservation and then were asked to wait and a hostess would take us to the table.  After about 5 minutes I asked why we were waiting since the place was empty....oh - I guess I can take you to the table said the guy who was still standing at the host stand.  It was the manager (LAME!!) ....everywhere we went they seemed woefully understaffed
minus^My husband couldn't get a cocktail server to bring him a cup of coffee. She referred him to Starbucks. As a guest, he felt free coffee should be available.
plus^The girl at the check-in was very nice and very helpful - unfortunately we don't remember her name! Room was nice and big.
minus^Overall I think it is way too expensive considering that you don't get any personal service, it's a big and loud hotel where you pay for the room and that's it. For this rate we would have at least expected a kettle in the room. Horrible long waiting times for the breakfast buffet plus it is quite expensive too - so we decided to go somewhere else.
plus^NONE
minus^The tower spa suite was dark and dated. Upgrade of room has extra charge. Spa bath is filthy with dirt on the edges. Carpet old and dated. Stench smell when entering the room. Entrance via dark corridor.
plus^Beds and comfort layers very comfortable .. shower was nice but leaked all the way through to toilet floor
minus^Would be nice to have 1 or 2 free water bottles in the room each day given the tap water is undrinkable .. sleeping next to “employees only” room means slamming door every few minutes for the crew to stock up their cleaning carts. - literally door rattles every time
plus^We liked the staff who helped us upgrade to a better room
minus^The pictures of the room on booking.com were no way like to pictures of the room we received. The lighting was poor. The room was tiny. The bathroom has no tub and looked like something from the 60s. We had to pay additional monies to pay for an upgraded room, which was the room we thought we were given. We feel booking.com falsely advertised.
plus^Much bigger rooms and bathrooms than other Vegas hotels!  Excellent service from staff of all areas!  We think people working there are happy and running a huge place like this can easily become chaotic!  Hence, bravo to the management!  Despite the property is so large, there is sufficient signage and the hotel provides a good map. If one does a little bit homework beforehand, should be no problem.  We also love the quick check out system which we used via the TV inside the room.
minus^Would be nice to have shower caps and slippers provided. The hot water doesn’t come until all the facets in the showers and sinks are turned on full blast for few minutes.
minus^Super bad , MGM ‘s room key system had super problems , it means two different unknown can use thier key enter my room.   Super bad,  and I report to MGM manager, she siad that’s fine, if you want to open to public, that’s fine , hhahahahahah!    Super bad
plus^The Avenue Cafe restaurant was very nice and had great staff.  The casino staff was welcoming...of course they were--they want you to spend all your money!  :-)  It's very easy to walk to the monorail.  Do not believe the reviews about hard to walk to the monorail.  You're lucky you didn't stay in the Bally or something like that.  I think the MGM monorail was probably the easiest monorail to get to.
minus^Staff attitude was very poor.  If the hotel staff was the deciding factor of how I determined my overall trip, it would rate a zero.  Their attitudes at check-in was surly and they were not willing to provide any information.  I was very polite and sociable, even with their poor attitudes.  In one of the restaurants, Wolfgang Puck, I was served a poultry dish even though the waitress offered to make it vegetarian (I didn't ask, and was willing to order a pure vegetarian dish).  She was also rude, but was nicer after I tipped her.  I asked the housekeeping staff to change my sheets--actually went looking for them one day and asked them to change them.  They assured me they would, and...they did not.  The television cable kept messing up my entire stay.  I will not return to the MGM Grand.
minus^Downfall:The hotel sent me an email regarding checking in. It advised my room will be ready when I receive an email advising it was ready, not before. I never received an email. I needed my room early,like 11:30am, but didnt check in until 4pm when I finally went to the counter to ask if my room was ready. The hotel waived the Resort Fee as compensation .
minus^Some staff,front desk,already confrontational (Rochelle)..i know the Latin Grammy were there,yet that had nothing to do with me..manage got evidence with no problem,no attitude and it didn't take 45 minutes... S/O accused of stiffing a restaurant when employee stole the money ...they wouldn't call police for the TRUTH..to see the surveillance tape..not sure of the other things going on...aybe the universe was against us. This was 1 of my favorite spots on the strip..NOW I'M SO HURT BY THESE ALLEGATIONS AND ACTIONS..Incidents in the world should unify us,not year us apart. Last Visit.
plus^MGM has amazing customer service, we ordered room service and it was delicious, had no problem getting a late check out. Our room was clean and a great size, beds were comfy.No shortage of clubs, bars and great restaurants in the casino. Would definitely stay here again.
minus^With the location of the hotel/casino being so far down the strip it made it harder to venture out to the rest of the Vegas strip but that's it.
minus^Checkin process was terrible. Staff doesn’t know much about the property. Customer service is non existent. The cigarette smoke makes gambling here impossible.
plus^Great (classic) Las Vegas hotel.  Amazing location right on the strip which was useful as there were lots of us at various hotels.  Very clean, staff helpful.  Great selection of restaurants.  Improved pool area - now two pools!!
minus^Very expensive compared to last time I visited Vegas and the MGM in 2002 - even taking the weakened pound into account - but that goes for most of Las Vegas.  That said, the MGM was particularly expensive at $9.50 a bottle of beer!!
plus^Tower Spa Suite was big.  Very roomy.  Spa tub was nice.  Bathroom was huge. Big windows.
minus^I used your mobile check in feature.  Worked somewhat well. Official hotel check in is 3pm.  The hotel knew we were there at 1pm.  Our room was ready at 3:30.  Found it a bit strange since we did the mobile check in that our room was ready a little late.  We figured it would be ready at 3 or maybe sooner. Also, we still had to check in at the desk.  Mobile check area was not working in the lobby. I asked for a view of the strip through booking.com and mobile checkin feature because we were celebrating our anniversary.  We got a view of the airport and the check in desk didn't even mention our anniversary.
plus^nice location
minus^A housekeeper knocked the door and yelled whether I needed housekeeping even before 9:30 am. I thought it's not for me but for her convenience.
minus^When checking in using the mobile check in it charged my credit card over 15 times which let my credit card company to put a fraud block on my credit card which enabled me to use my credit card for a few days.  This was one of the most unpleasant experiences that I have dealt with in Vegas and this was the first time I’ve stayed at the MGM Grand.
plus^The casino was great and the staff was friendly and professionally.
minus^My room was dirty, shower had mold in it, the A/C didn't work and the shower didn't turn on.
plus^Good bed. Staff were great to clean the room around our timetable.
minus^It was a special period for myself and partner, it would have been nice to have a bigger window and view of the strip, especially as we stayed 6 nights.
plus^Rooms were great
minus^Las Vegas needs to introduce smoke free areas of the casinos. All the casinos in Vegas allow smoking so it’s pretty uncomfortable for non smokers
plus^Most of the staff were friendly  Some at front desk need some training
minus^The price you quoted me and the price I️ paid were not the same. We got there at 7:30 at night and our room was not ready. We had ask for a room with a view and that did not happen. We will be going back there
plus^Quiet,
minus^Water smells and the restroom handle was poorly screwed and feel like the glass door would be breaking. Also occasionally i could smell smoke in the room.
plus^Liked the proximity to the strip and the overall atmosphere of the hotel and staff.
minus^Bathroom counter way too small.Dated furniture in room. Overall cost... booking.com had room posted at $159 but at time of purchase a surprise resort fee of $40 was attached as well as being required to pay for parking. Cost alone I would have booked somewhere else.
plus^Nice room
minus^Stressful getting there, parking, registering and finding our room.  Kind of expensive,  since we were just looking for a comfortable bed before our early morning flight out. Of course,  it may be unfair to compare with the Grand Canyon National Park's El Tovar Lodge and Zion National Park's The Lodge, where we had spent the previous nights. 
plus^The room was well sized for two guests with two large beds. The pool was great.
minus^The TV didn’t work for two days and you’re unable byo waters to store in the fridge as there is a charge.  The pool service if not in a cabana is pretty ordinary with little to no service.
plus^Bed was very comfortable. Room was nice size with good view of airport. Food was good as well as the entertainment. The outdoor area was nice with a choice of pools. Location fit with good access to where we wanted to go.
minus^I enjoy a cup of coffee in the AM, no coffee maker in room, had to go to Restaurant area. Also, no refrigerator in room.
minus^One of the best place to stay with everything you need.  awesome amenities and clean rooms.  If you are a foodies try our their breakfast or dinner buffet. worth every single penny.
plus^Bed was comfortable
minus^Paper thin walls could hear everything in next room. No tea or coffee facilities. Not allowed to use the fridge for yourself have to buy what they stock in it and you can’t remove anything. Hotel doesn’t smell good when you first enter. Booked 2 rooms 8 months in advance requesting they be connecting or at least close but they weren’t even in the same corridor. I wouldn’t recommend this hotel, plenty of others that are cheaper and better.
plus^Angela at the Avenue Cafe. Helpful and friendly staff. Emeril’s. Access to Monorail. Loved the shower! Good maid service. Good bed and bedding.
minus^No privacy in bathroom. Squeaking door. Pillows too soft. Too few free channels on TV. Long, long, long hallway between elevator and room. Big giant water conservation sticker covering mirror! Bad sink and no counter. Can’t dim lights. Uncomfortable chair. Bad internet access. Confusion on checkout.
plus^we really liked the location on the strip
minus^The MGM is very large , this may be viewed by some as a positive thing, but next time I would opt for a smaller hotel.
plus^It's on the strip, Good bars, decent Hasakan club. (You must boom guest list though to get in as with all good Vegas clubs) good sized pools
minus^The north tower. It appears to be an afterthought and is basically somewhere they store items for the hotel rooms with some rooms thrown in. The corridor to our room was horrible and makes you feel as though you're not meant to be staying at the mgm. The room itself was ok, but the view was of a concrete block. I've since read other complaints about this and the theme seems to be that they thrown third party providers, such as booking.com in this tower so shame on you both. 
plus^Staff was nice. Casino was nice. Lots of attractions.
minus^The bed was the most uncomfortable bed Ive ever slept in. Booked the Grand King online but didn't appear to be the same room shown online. Really could've used a refrigerator in the room.
plus^It’s clean and spacious rooms and modern.
minus^I was not worried about a view but some people are and my view was just a roof. Tge thing that was anoying is navagating from the lobby to the room. The hotel is so hudge but the signs in these casinos are scarce.
plus^gym is ok
minus^Cost of meals. Over a $100 for a meal for one is a joke. Rooms are old and very in need of refurbishment. Won't stay again until the above changes. Shops asking for ID everytime even for a $5 purchase. its offensive to be asked for ID for my own debit cards. I refused to buy from them.....
minus^Entered the room to find a wet, used towel lying on the surface of the sink. Upgraded to a suite which was filled with a smell of smoked bacon, wouldn’t recommend it at all.
plus^Lovely rooms, very comfortable and a good size, big bathrooms too.
minus^Lazy river pool was closed for autumn, its 35 degrees outside!  the main reason I booked the hotel was for the pool, disappointed with that.
plus^It is a massive Hotel, over 6000 rooms i imagine. So imagine the queue during the checkin. However surprisingly the staff were very efficient and you dont have to stand in line for over 10 mins which is ok. The hotel has plenty of pools, a mall inclusive and many places to eat.  also there is an easy metro that takes you to the center of vegas city
minus^The facilities concentrate on quantity but not on quality....mainly the pools. The sun chairs are poor quality, the staff don't come to you asking for drinks... The full facilities close by 6ish even the retail shops resto close by 10
minus^Too far to pool to find out not was booked for a private event. Only reason we stayed was for outside pool amenities. Very disappointed. Will not stay at a hotel owned by MGM ever again
minus^Hi  I have not received my security deposit since I checked out on 10 October 2017.  Please advise urgently. Thanks. Regards Navern Naidoo
plus^Hotel was amazing, people, staff, area, attitudes etc... was all perfect... I was there when the vegas masacre occurred, right across the street. The staff would not have handled the situation better... security and housekeeping had the hotel on lock down and had bedding for everyone as we could not leave...
minus^My only criticism is that during the lockdown they could have re-opened the shop as everything else was open... women needed feminine products etc and lots of people needed water.... the shop in the hotel has extortionate prices
plus^The beds were very comfortable and the hotel was within walking distance of all the top places.
minus^Staff had a poor attitude and we got treated very poorly in the Hakkasan Nightclub by the bar staff.
minus^This May be silly to some, but there were no black out curtains, they were sheer curtains where the sun totally came through. It’s Vegas, I want to sleep during the day!
plus^The view on the non-airport side was wonderful.
minus^I would have liked a microwave in the room.  Most rooms have them and I expected it.  Even brought my own tea bags.
plus^MGM great location to enjoy the shows we wanted to see.  Easy elevator access and travel time. Fantastic staff in every interaction. Very quiet floor & room location. Anna (Concierge) was delightful, caring, knowledgeable and wonderful to work with.  All of her assistance added greatly to our trip.  The show KA was more than spectacular. Loved everything about it. Great restaurant choices, fantastic food and cocktails.
minus^The room was not as nice as I had hoped for. Very clean, but just not much more appeal than a very budget conscious hotel room. TV continued to lose connectivity. The repair response was rapid. But the problem continued throughout our stay. The view from our window was the backside of the front of the hotel sign. Ugly!!! Although it appeared almost everyone on the floor was respectful of the no smoking requirement, there was one or two rooms that you had to travel past to reach the elevators, that reeked of cigarette smoke. Using an inhaler due to cigarette smoke allergy caused me to reconsider which elevator to take which put me in the part of the casino I did not spend time in. Finally, and sadly I think it is time the casino interior get a a make over! 
plus^Very friendly and helpful staff. Quick and easy check. Great furnishings and decorated rooms. Very comfortable beds and well oriented rooms with great views. Ice machine with a vending machine on each floor. The gym has plenty of machines and great diverse options. The Underground has some of the best restaurants of all of Vegas. The monorail ends at the MGM and It’s an easy place to hop on and travel northbound to all the other Vegas Strip Properties without having to drive.
minus^Their was some vomit dried on the wall by the bed and the glass on the pictures in the rooms looked as if someone sneezed on them.  It wasn’t too obvious but enough for a particular person to take notice. The plumbing backed up in tub to the sink. It took a while for someone to come and fix it but then it was repaired it was cleaner than before. We were upgraded upon check in for free but upon check out we were charged for the upgrade. People must review their bill before checking out for errors.
plus^rooms where big and beds comfy
minus^the location wasn't right for us I would of preferred to be on the middle of the strip. the drinks where very expensive around the pool and we had to pay a full resort fee even though half the pool facilities were closed. There is no shops near by which makes you use the shops inside the hotel which are very over priced. if things were priced better people would by double and enjoy there stay better. a cocktail round the pool was 16 dollars!!
plus^The room was spacious and I love the bathroom. The beds were very comfortable and the view was awesome. I appreciated the selection of restaurants at the hotel. The proximity to shopping and other hotels was great too.  I have to say our afternoon at the pool was the most fun!
minus^I could still smell cig smoke in the room and more so in the hallway.
plus^The location of the hotel was perfect walking distance from everything!!!
minus^You're paying for the great location only. The room was the size of a dorm room. It also lacked amenities such as microwave or a refrigerator. Extremely disappointed at first, but the location made up for the small room.
plus^the location. nothing else.
minus^there was no room service (they forgot our room), the room was dark, loud, dingy, musty. the room was 20 walking minutes away from the swimming pool, although i requested one close to the pool.
plus^NOTHING ... Well actually we liked the store in the Lobby ! Excellent clothing selections , everything we needed was there. And the staff was superb , friendly helpful in the store.   And we thoroughly enjoyed KA!! But we LEFT and booked OUT of MGM , thank the Lord, and came over just for KA on a different night .
minus^The rooms,  not even little lotions etc in bathrooms, the entire floor and other floors smelled like pot, NOT AT ALL family friendly environment from the lobby to the pools! The pool areas were horrible for families. Just a big pot smoking party on every level ! And some might really enjoy that but it was not for a family. It is a HUGE walk to anywhere else on the strip so take a cab. It offers nothing for families.
plus^ The staff and cleaning crew were very cordial and polite.  When I had to change rooms because of construction noise,  everyone was accommodating. 
minus^The paper thin walls for the rooms.  I could hear the neighbors pee and wash.  The construction noise was terrible.  Kept me up at night.  Then the parking fees. I was charged $20 when I checked out. Then another $20 at the parking Kiosk.  ???
plus^We had great rooms at a great price. The service staff at the reception area were very helpful and friendly.
minus^We had no recommendations for improvement.
plus^Online check-in and check-out saved time. Useful link to monorail. Not far from airport with shuttle bus available.
minus^The room was hard to find, involving a convoluted walk through the casino to a long, dark corridor, into a gloomy lift and back along another long, dark corridor. The decor was tatty and dark in the room too. I don't want to set foot in MGM Grand again.
plus^The room was clean
minus^The maintenance worker knocking on the door while we were asleep  to check the bar I thought that should have been done after I was checked out
plus^The location was great and the bars and restaurants were brilliant.
minus^Compared to my daughter's room we were disappointed.  Their room looked onto New York New York hotel.  Next time we'll ask for a higher floor.
plus^Nothing
minus^I room was not like what was shown on web. The room was very small.  It was not ready at time I requested.  I was charged 30 a day got resort fee.  30 a day to change rooms to another area. I was charged 300 deposit. None of this which I was told. I already paid for first night. So I was basically stuck.
plus^This is a classic Vegas Hotel that offers all the resort options you would expect. The pool was amazing with the river pool being a real favourite for our 6 year old son. We enjoyed seeing the amazing Cirque du Soleil production 'KA' that's inside the hotel.
minus^MGM Grand is starting to show its age. The self parking options are still a long way from the lobby and they still charge you $12 / day. Be warned there is still a hefty $35 / day resort fee and taxes on top of all that. It's still quite a walk from the main Vegas attractions and the monorail costs $12 /day.
plus^We were in the West Wing in a lovely, well-furbished room right at the end of a very long corridor! It was a quiet location, away from the crowds.
minus^A coffee machine in the room is surely an essential in the 21st Century - but not in our room!!
plus^The atmosphere was good and the room quiet for good sleeping.
minus^Lack of charging points for phones and devices there was nothing near the the bed which I found a little inconvienient. The room was rather dated in that sense not mod tech friendly. Perhaps the outdated bedside clock radio could be updated fo a bedside charger/ media player speaker/digital radio?
minus^Great Service Staff in Coffee Shop and Emirils. I forgot the names but as a Chef they explained everything and did upsell in professional way with knowledge of the food.
minus^We went for the jacuzzi tub and our cold water knob was broken and the tub looked a little dirty. The restroom ceiling looked like it was warping.Also our neighbor would yell when talking on the phone so we heard her often. Not horrible stay but expected a little better for spending the money we did on a suite
plus^I love how clean and comfortable the room was.
minus^I didn’t like the fact that it didn’t say anywhere about a deposit online or when I called so I had to leave a $200 dollar deposit.
plus^The staff is not friendly at all no were in the room to to store drinks in. The channels on the tv wouldn't work. Some of the staff like at the front desk was very rude and this was my first trip to vegas the hotel very nice but I don't think the staff is friendly at all.
minus^The staff and that the channels kept going out on the tv the the bed had dirty stains on it when we first got their.
plus^The building and grounds were kept clean. The pool area was nice. Lots of on property choices for food. Lots of entertainment. The staff was nice.
minus^The rooms were dated and old looking. Prices at shops were extremely high. There was a bar with a really loud band every day. Any were you went from the parking lot to your room was a long walk. some times 4 to 5 football fields long.
plus^The room was very modern and set up well.
minus^The booking was advertised at $72 per night. Great rate right? Wrong, they neglected to mention the $40 resort fee that was tacked on to the cost of the room. Honestly, the fee was probably mentioned somewhere in the fine print but it’s a shady way to get more money out of people. Don’t advertise a room for $72 and then sneak a hefty “Resort Charge” in there. Left me with a bad feeling about the whole situation.
minus^The bathroom ceiling paint hand peeled off. The room was not really well dusted. Particles of dust was on the mini center table and sitting area by the window. Room was a bit too dark for my liking. For the price paid, the room could certainly have offered more or be better. I would not choose this place for the future.
plus^The beds were very comfy. Shower was brilliant. Location was a bonus too.
minus^Having to queue up with people who were checking in when all we needed was to reset the card to get into our room.
minus^Was shocked to see the room  so badly set up could not walk around never accepted from MGM grand Room had absolutely no Day light so we had to stay outside most of the dayOn the other side the front desk charged me two times resort fee .
plus^The bed was good.
minus^Noisy - people spilling out of the lift at 3-4am woke us up and I am a heavy sleeper. The door wasnt very soundproof. The room was sparse.
plus^The croupiers were were proffesional. 
minus^We booked a smoking room, that was clearly stated available while booking. When we arrived at MGM reception staff stated that they do not have smoking rooms for the past 4 years, they just never updated information crucial for us. We also did not receive any complimentary breakfast or sth similar as an apology. Room is old, outdated,  worn, dusty. Shower head was not working properly, and only one electrical outlet was working in room. Small casino compared to other resorts. On check out the person who worked at reception yelled at us, while leaning over the reception desk. Never had this terrible experience in my life. We ask him to apologise he just left. A while later when the manager arrived, he was professional, but then again the gentlemen who was yelling at us before returned and threatened us, while yelling really aggressively. He was upset because we asked him why was an additional 456 $ deducted from our bank card. He kept saying that it did not happen even though I had proof from my bank messaging me that they deducted this for, no reason. He threatened to call security to escort us out while we were calm and collected he started flailing his arms and yelling at the express line in a packed lobby. Also they took an additional charge for mini bar usage while the mini bar was locked, so it does not make any sense. Worst stay ever. We also had to spend 2 hours negotiating with MGM and booking on the phone, that we don't get charged extra for early check out due to completely incorrect information. Money was deducted and still is at the end. We will never return there.
minus^Had a wonderful stay at the MGM in September - our room was beautiful and very spacious for 4 girls! We did unfortunately have some substantial charges added to our room that weren't realised until after our departure, however this was quickly resolved by the staff once we made contact. Will definitely be back!
plus^the position of the hotel
minus^bathroom was not comfortable and seems old and not very clean, the room was not very clean too, small, the minibar can not be opened (was blocked). In general the property is old.
minus^The phone was dirty, the sheets had some stains, the WiFi didn't work for the first 2 hours (they told me, I should be grateful, as it usually might take up to 24hours) staff was not very helpful: for example they made me wait 25 minutes in wet bathing trunks because the key simply stopped working when I came back from the pool (told me it's due to security reasons, only to hand me a new pair of keys without ever checking any ID a few hours later when I asked for the parking validation...). The room keeping on our check out day waking us up at about 8 just rounds up the experience. If you keep in mind,what they charge per night, this isn't what you should expect. We stayed at the Hilton 2 nights before this, and the Hilton was much better and just what one would expect from such a hotel. I will not stay at the MGM again, all my other stays at hotels on the strip were far more pleasant.
plus^-Great location -Room was spacious and bed was comfy -Very clean
minus^We attended here for my Mum's wedding for 4 nights. The whole trip went perfect however after I attended, MGM did not take the £800 hold off my card which resulted in payments bouncing from my card. When I rang, I was told this would take up to 7 working days. This didn't come off which resulted in me having to contact my bank to get them to lift the hold. The staff I spoke to at the hotel weren't very helpful or sympathetic. Also, making calls to America from the UK has resulted in me having a £100 phone bill. Will not stay here again.
plus^Not a thing
minus^Asked for view got ally. I didn't ask for a room with a sticker over the Windows. Got that too. My reward for saying anything was the crap veiw of the ally AND BLACK STUFF IN THE SHOWER after booking upper foor with view. And WE DON'T CARE/GUARANTEE ROOM VIEWS. I HAD THE BEST SEVICE FROM THE TUX GUY VINCE AND LIMO GUY FROM BELL. NOT MGM. THEY DIDN'T EVEN CARE THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE MARRIED.  Long line's for coffee and food in am 
plus^Comfy bed. Lots of hot water. Friendly staff
minus^Husband lost hat in casino. Their lost & found listed hats as hat. No description of markings on hat so it could be identified!!....as patriots hat, NYYhat, pink hat etc
plus^Staff were excellent and friendly! Super helpful. We were there the night of October 1st which was a very stressful time, the hotel did its best to keep the situation under control and keep the guests safe. We sheltered a staff member in our room over night and there was also another minor issue which once mentioned to the desk manager, he gave our first night for free and upgraded us to spa suite! Rooms were great with loads of space and comfy beds. Hotel amenities were brilliant and they have some lovely restaurants and shops. We liked the grand buffet and thought it was quite cheap considering the options available. The pool was lovely, although get there early if you want to claim a lounger! Casino was good and my husband enjoyed the poker tables! Location on the strip is great and there is a car rental desk and concierge to help with the rest of your trip!
minus^Nothing that I can think of.
plus^Not much...
minus^The room was in the West Wing with almost no natural light and difficult access down a very long corridor - we felt like we were underground - thank God it was only for one night !!
minus^Staff at front desk and at curbside not friendly. Some of hotel rooms renovated; some not. Hotel felt like a maze.  Very smoky (more than other hotels).
plus^Most things were fine
minus^Our shade in our room was broken.  They fixed it promptly.  I am very disappointed with the lack of hot water for my shower.  I thought maybe i just need to run the water for a while and it would warm up but it never did.  Unfortunately we were checking out within the hour so I had to take a freezing cold shower.  It was awful!  I've never had a cold shower in a hotel ever!  We told the staff, and they informed us that I should've let the water run longer.  No!  I already took the freezing cold shower. It never warmed up.  She offered to have it checked but I told her we were checking out anyways.  As we were checking out we informed the staff about it again and he apologized and was very nice to us.  The only thing he could do was refund the resort fee.  But really, if you pay $180 for a place to sleep and shower, taking 40 off isn't sufficient.  For a grand place like MGM Grand it's surprising that nothing more was done to make us want to return.   We also were told that next time we book we should always take the upgrade and pay a little more.  Otherwise we get stuck with the old rooms.  That's not good.  Maybe all your rooms should be up to standard.
minus^I stayed in the Grand Tower. The sunlight is too weak in my room, so it was quite dark. In addition, the housekeeper broke in without knocking the door at around 7:30 or 8:00 am in the morning, which disturbed my sleep.
plus^2nd time travelling to the MGM. hotel, beds and restaurants including food court are great
minus^during my 1st time I had difficult to get hot water in the bathroom. this time the water in the sink was taking too long to get away
minus^Service didn’t clean our room properly and it was overpriced for the room. They said we were upgraded but the room we had was dark with dim lighting. Didn’t feel like we were in the MGM Grand. Poor experience.
minus^I did not know there was coffee in MGM - answer to question of how was coffee at MGM? I suppose it must be very good. They upgraded my room (free of charge), when the hotel was not much full, for which we are grateful.
minus^We were there at Route 91 during the shooting. The check out clerk was unsympathetic and rude when we checked out. The shower was also dirty and gross.  We will not be coming back here, too many other hotels that will want our business to choose from.
plus^Mobile check in was good. We dont have to queue to get the key
minus^Our room smell really really bad. Looks like they put some chemical to the carpet that didn't dry up yet. No complimentary even a bottle of water. When we checked out using tv check out there were lots of item on the bill that we dont buy. Glad that we checked it otherwise it will be charge to our account.
plus^The room had good space. The pool area was nice and hotel had a lot of nice restaurants and bars inside.
minus^The AC in the room was awful, lighting was poor in the room. Room seemed very dated and in need of a refurb. Honestly some of the newer hotel I would be more inclined to stay at.
plus^Very lively place, Good food court with a lot of variety. Nice casino.
minus^The front office staff is indifferent. I wanted a room on the higher floors but was given a room on the lowest floor.
plus^Very grand and very nice staff
minus^The check-in could do with a better and faster process/system. The automatic charge for the minibar is a little downside, especially when i get charged when i didnt use it.
plus^The atomosphere of the hotel and friendly staff. Central location.
minus^Having to walk through casino to get to my room every time, but in Vegas I think it would be hard not to.
plus^I was able to book into their ja==Jacuzzi Tower Suite, and while the decoration were  was not to my liking, the suite itself was magnificent. The staff were completely  responsible and professional and the restaurants were truly top notch. if one is looking at an excellent and memorable experience, the MGM Grand is the hotel.
minus^The property lived up to its reputation.  in terms of professional service and amenities. On the other hand I do prefer the intimacy of a small boutique hotel, one where it does not take 20 minutes to walk to the pool, one which is not over run with tens of thousand of beer-carrying cigarette- smoking patrons blurting out foul  language ,where the noise level is down 500 percent, where the dress standards are higher than dirty t-shirts and cutoffs.
plus^The size and things to do. Amazing facilities and the pool was awesome. 
minus^Initial arrival, room smelt bad and hadn't been cleaned properly. Was corrected promptly though. 
plus^Tower Spa Suite - Beautiful room. Our view was the roof of the garage on the 8th floor (bummer) Pristine (no dirt anywhere). Staff were VERY friendly.  We were able to check our bags before check in, and got an email when our room was ready. That was convenient.
minus^Watch out for the mini bar - When the bellman brought our bags up he told us that if we keep anything more than 20 seconds we'd be charged for it, even if we put it back.  Thankfully! I called the front desk right away, and had everything removed from the bill that we DIDN'T use. Parking was strange - have to walk through a large empty (dark underground!) corridor to get to the hotel lobby.  When we tried to leave, the instructions were to insert our room key, but it didn't work. We got to the gate, it didn't work there either.  Pushed the button, and the person let us out.
plus^The location was good, facility's were good.
minus^Staff were only interested in talking to you if you were wanting to spend money! Very little service if you were on a budget!
plus^Loved the facilties in and out of the room! Great location and friendly staff.
minus^Quiet expensive for drinks and food. No offers or discounts on facilities for staying guests.
plus^MGM is a great Casino / entertainment centre and is well located but the rooms leave something to be desired.
minus^Room was a bit old, the shower was not good, didn't work well and was poorly designed and neither was the toilet which were both entirely glass walled. Couldn't even get cold water to have a glass of water at night and there was no fridge in the room either. It is an extremely long walk from the room back to the casino but in fairness it is a very large casino.
minus^The rooms at the West Wing were a little outdated especially the shower. We had no shower gel like most hotels provide and during our 4day stay in MGM, no soap bars were replenished.
plus^Great location and some goo restrooms.
minus^TV signal didn't work. Toilet did a pitched sound every time it was flushed, Bathroom door would close, and shower was not very clean.
plus^Nice room  Nice bathroom  Comfy bed  Great location
minus^Why not offer free wifi how much would cost you Only there overnight so object to paying resort fees as arrived late
plus^I like the MGM for location only. The room I stayed in was tiny and the bathroom was all glass- even the door to the bathroom. I am a smaller person so it was heavy and not as welcome a feeling as other rooms in Las Vegas. It was a cheap stay for the MGM
minus^the glass cabinets in the bathroom- and there was NO natural light
plus^Comfortable room, good beds.
minus^There is smoking in the casino which smells disgusting and gets on ones clothes just by walking through the rooms. Should not be allowed.
plus^ 
minus^It's dirty, the floors does not feel like it's swept or cleaned when I checked in. The pictures online looks alot better than when I visit the room. One of the drawers were broken and wasn't repaired when I checked in.  
plus^The location is graet  and confortable& clean
minus^I was here for three nights booked by booking app which was in amount of 356 $ but after i checked out iwas suprise the got 200$  extra without any right i did email booking but unfortunately they didi not response  i under stand that there is a rax  and fee for the resort which is include in my invoice but the extra amount they got it from me was that the last night they duplicate the price. So guys check the invoice before leaving i was late in my flight so not checked otherwise i will rejected... cheers
plus^Excellent value for money, right in the heart of Vegas, convenient to walk around and take public transport with friendly staff.
minus^The staff was very good
plus^The bed was comfortable and the shower was okay. Ultimately that's all that really matters I suppose. It is nice that the rooms are smokefree.
minus^No coffee making facilities provided. Resort fee is steep when you don't get anything for it. We weren't there to use the pool, so really it was very expensive wifi! The room was dark and dated. We had a much nicer room when we stayed in 2014 and that was why we chose to stay here again. This time we were obviously in the budget wing, but the price wasn't any cheaper!! We will try somewhere else next time.  Housekeeping was hit and miss. Didn't refresh our shampoo etc and didn't take our wet towels (clearly piled on the bathroom floor). All they seemed to do was straighten the bed. We basically gave up on housekeeping and just requested fresh towels. There was a massive pile of used towels when we vacated the room!!
plus^The location and parking facilities were great. The pool looked fantastic but we weren't there long enough to swim. Room size was excellent
minus^Room cleanliness was below standards  Pillows and bed weren't comfy Aircon was loud and clunky  Cold showers and mould in shower Old and in need of a refurb Both nights room was only serviced for 4 when we had 5 people Level 4 view of concrete roof
minus^Key could not work on first room, second room given was dirty & not been clean, 1 hour later 3rd room was fine...... this was our surprise room for our wedding night.....not impressed !!!!
plus^I like the stay well environment a lot: purified air, aroma therapy and a great lighting experience. The hotel has everything from casinos to pools, spas to restaurants and ready access to the mono rail for getting to other destinations on the strip.
minus^I was assured via booking.com my request for  later check-out (4-5PM) would be accommodated only to arrive and find out it was not the case. On the day of checking out I was only allowed up to noon. My flight was not till 6:30PM. I didn't appreciate the discrepancy in information.
plus^COMFORTABLE BED AND ADEQUATE LIGHTING IN THE BATHROOM.  OTHER THAN THAT THE ROOM WAS RATHER DULL , MINIMUM LIGHTING AND BASIC.
minus^RECEPTION GREETING WAS GOOD ALTOUGH THE TACTICS MGM USE GIVE YOU NO OPTION BUT TO UPGRADE AT EXTRA COSTS.  THE ROOM IN THE WEST WING WAS EXTREMELY DARK AND BASIC DESPITE PAYING FOR AN UPGRADE - NOT A PATCH ON THE VENITIAN OR BELLAGIO WHERE WE NORMALLY STAY - I WOULD NOT RATE THIS HOTEL ANY HIGHER THAN 3 STAR.
plus^Nothing
minus^Staff was rude and unhelpful, when I called to get an early check in they were extremely rude and snappy to me and wouldn't help at all. There was someone smoking a lot on our floor and it constantly smelled, anytime I called down to try and get help with anything the phone would ring and ring. I tried called about a noise complaint one night at 12am and the phone rang for 20 minutes and no one ever answered. The vending machine on the floor was broken, everything was dirty and old looking. I will never recommend this place to anyone. They also expect you to keep your parking ticket all weekend which is just crazy to me considering it's vegas. You should be able to just say how many nights your there and they charge your room.
plus^I really liked that it was very easy to pay at multiple MGM properties by simply charging it to the room. Saved time and was really convenient if you didn't have cash or forgot your wallet, just needed to show your ID.
minus^I didn't like that we paid so much money for nice accommodations to have absolutely no perks with our room. We had a fully stocked refrigerator that was nice but of course everything was over priced so we didn't use it. But I hated that if we emptied the fridge there would be a $50 restocking fee and if we moved anything and didn't put it back we would be charged for it after 40 seconds (so we were told by staff) then if we wanted to a fridge to put things we wanted in we had to pay $25 a day! There was no microwave or even a little coffee pot to make coffee in our room that most of your basic hotels have. I mean come on. I get that it's Las Vegas but when you dish out money like that your hotel should offer some basic amenities. Just my opinion.
plus^+ free upgrade as our room was not ready + hotel Next to the strip + Wi-Fi was ok, also skype was possible + parking is possible with self-service with parking ticket on the room card (12$ per day) + checkout is easy via tv or tablet
minus^o It’s that big, that you might get lost o Missing signs to get to the self-parking
plus^The facilities were well appointed and the room was quiet and comfortable.
minus^I was not aware of the US$38 charge for the resort facilities which I did not want nor request. It was a compulsory charge and made a joke of the discounted room rate. I feel cheated and taken advantage of. Please address!
plus^Wet Republic, pool, everything. Anything that you want from a hotel. MGM has it. You could go on holiday to this hotel and never need to leave.
minus^Going home.
plus^Beautiful place with lots of options to eat from $$$to food court ! Easy access to uber or taxi , or just step outside and explore the Vegas strip by walking ! Friendly staff !
minus^No refrigerator or microwave in the room
plus^Did not like much about the MGM, big hype for nothing.
minus^The customer service was not good, the floor and room was dirty, dark, looked like prison cells, and was not worth the money.  They double billed by card, and when I called about the discrepancy, staff was rude. I have stayed at cheaper hotels for a better looking room with better accommodations.
plus^The spa suite with the jacuzzi bath, is worth every dollar. There was easy access to metrorail. All the staff were incredible. This hotel is much nicer than the other hotels on the strip. Would highly reccommend this hotel!
minus^At end of strip, but super close to airport, so cancels out. It's a big hotel but not too bad.
plus^MGM is top notch as far as the Vegas experience. Casino, Pool, Restaurants were all great.
minus^The only bad experience was with an employee at the pool. He worked the counter where we purchased tubes for the lazy river. He was very condescending, and spoke to us like we were stupid. He definitely needed remedial training in customer service.
plus^A good selection of bars and restaurants. 
minus^The noise of the toilet syston in my room re-filling every 5 minutes was really load and annoying. Just as you are beginning to drift off to sleep it would wake you. The room key cards are poor and would often fail to open my door resulting in the very long walk to reception after a long day in the heat. The restrooms at poolside smelt really bad and the floor was stained with urine and the corner of the floor was cracked and beginning to peel up. 
plus^The MGM Grand hotel is massive, its a little city in itself! It has everything you need.
minus^As the hotel is so large you don't really get personalised service there from the staff like you would at a smaller hotel. Big lines at check in at times, but moves fairly quickly.
plus^It's Vegas...everyone has to go there once.  The pool area was fabulous although we got there too late for a swim after a hot drive through the desert....it closed at 7!  We went there  early the next day before checkout.
minus^OMG where to start...hotel way too big...so much noise....the room was fine.  Just really not our thing.  We were on a cross country from Ottawa Ontario to visit our son in San Fransisco and thought we might as well visit Vegas as we were close.  One thing that REALLY bugged us all accross the country was the lack of recycling opportunities.  Do Americans really not care about the environment?
minus^Our room was awesome with a stunning view at the city. Location  couldn't be better. Our second time here,I'm sure we will return. The breakfast was super.
plus^The Sports Bar Tap.
minus^We stayed in the West Wing. The room was very small and uncomfortable. The elevator is poorly located at the far end of a narrow long dark claustrophobic hallway. Hallway signage is poor. Restaurants are greatly overpriced with customers walking by after looking at menus. Self parking is awkward and with little or no guidance as how to do it, almost forcing people to use the valet parking. getting from the valet parking area to the hotel lobby was liking crossing a 6 lane freeway at rush hour.
plus^Well I'm a sun and water fan and the lazy river was fabulous! Also if you didn't want to be in the sun, there were shady areas or you could rent a cabana. There were one person cabanas right at the lazy river. Mattress was as comfortable as my Sleep # bed at home.
minus^The pre made salads at the grill in the pool area were expensive and disgusting. Much better to just go into the food court directly inside and get food there. Nathans offered a chicken Caesar with a grilled breast and shaved parmesan.
minus^Busy, staff with the exception of the check in was just OK...not overly friendly.  Bell desk took 40 minutes and still did not deliver my luggage to the room.  I retrieved it myself. Casino area was extremely smoky...need to upgrade the ventilation system.
plus^Rooms were great. Excellent location. Some Amazingly friendly and helpful staff members.
minus^Not kid friendly really. Huge property so you spend a lot of time finding your way out of the property.  The crazy mini bar system that if you even lift an item to consider it, you are charged. No way to use the fridge for cooling water for the kids. All based on making money but it is a casino!
plus^Location, buffet was great selection.  Staff all had great customer service.  Ameneties were always  clean.
minus^Smelt way too much like cigarette smoke although I know a lot of the hotel do.  Checked into our first room- Smelt like loads of smoke, sewerage smell from bathroom and phone didn't work. Second room easy 'stay well' much better but still smells like smoke, one of our sinks wouldn't drain, shower leaked.
plus^One place with everything. Food, casino, pool, club, shows, stores etc. so you could stay here the entire time.
minus^MGM is located at the end of the strip so you will walk and pay for cabs depending on what you're trying to do and see. However the walk isn't that bad. Average 20 minute walk.
plus^Very comfortable bed and very clean room.The room was as described.
minus^Some of the appliances like bathrobe are not accurate. Noise  from the ventilation and airconditioning system was too loud.
plus^Very comfortable bed and hotel floor. Rooms were quite big.
minus^Staff was a bit uptight. Completely dismissed when I told was my birthday and was looking forward to it. Carrying the luggage from the parking lot to the hotel room is quite a journey. The room was nice but rather old. Toilet sits on a dark corner on the bathroom. Cracks on the sink and the sink gargles when the toilet is flushed. When the jacuzzi tub was emptied, the shower next to it started gushing out water from the drain, flooding the bathroom. Housekeeping took a long time to clean that up. Outside noises from construction nearby were very noticeable in the morning. Not really what you expect for such a pricy hotel room.
plus^Rooms are nicely done also pool was nice
minus^Room charges should be more transparent. Tax in Vegas is 8 or 8.5. But somehow they charge 13.5% A bit high and the charges for resort fee needs to be in bigger print and included as your checking out on all websites so there are no surprises.  Also MGM says nothing about having to buy float device. But dose say renting them. Con!
plus^theroom was a great size, thebed was super comfortable.
minus^The room was a little bit dusty, you could smell smoke at times even though we were in a smoke free room and are non smokers ourselves. I had requested an early check via email and phone, was told ok on phone but then no rooms were ready when we arrived. They told us they would text us when our room was ready, but no text came through so we had to go back after the check in time to find our room was in fact ready. The food options in the complex weren't amazing, no healthy options.
plus^The customer service was great. We had a family emergency and had to check out mid trip... when we checked out the rep took it upon her self to ask her manager to give us a refund for the night we wouldn't not be there, and it was granted. We were shocked bc we didn't ask for it but we were very grateful that she did that.
minus^We had asked for non smoking and the room we got smelled like the smoking section and the room was horrible. So We called to upgrade to another room. It was $20 extra a night for the upgrade. They mentioned this was their updated tower. Once we got to the room it was larger but the room definitely wasn't a new room or one that appeared upgraded.  When I jumped into the shower I noticed the showered curtain was all black/Moldie from the bottom and I had other unknown black marks on it. We immediately called and they had it switched out. I was expecting something better and nicer... I probably wouldn't not stay here again.
minus^Bathroom tub was clogged, water handle was broken and 2 drunk guest tried using their key to open my room door....scary....for the price I paid it should have been A LOT BETTER. This was not my first time staying at MGM but it was never this bad 😡😡😡
plus^it was clean and quiet.
minus^I expected the room would be more spacious with more amenities. It was a very standard room. The air condition took a long time to cool down the room.
minus^room great, facility great, would have been better if the walkway to new York/new York had not been being repaired. It required quite a bit of extra walking. Also would have helped if some signs had been posted informing your quests.
plus^- In the prime area of Vegas. Don't need to spend money on taxi to travel on the strip cause you're living there. - Good entertainment and bars
minus^- Ugly entrance to north wing. It is as if a staff entrance, did not recognise it all.  - Side entrances to the hotel are very shady. Be aware of your surroundings. -The taxes are heavy and hotel pool/gym fees are forced into the bill.  - Lobby can smell of dirty cigarettes. - Check-in queues are terrible. - No electric plug converters built into the wall. - No kettle, tea or coffee in the room (Necessity for us British) - Room fridge has contents costing a leg and an arm.  - Shower water smelled of chemicals. - View of a wall from our room (hopefully better for you reading)
plus^Friendly staff on the floors.  Try not checking in at 3:00pm. Great selection of places to eat.
minus^Too much smoke in all the common area and casino. If you are the first at a table you can ask for it to be non-smoking. It really helped.
plus^Our room was comfortable and convenient! The shower was especially pleasant, although it didn't drain very quickly. We dined at Wolfgang Puck our first night and it was delicious.
minus^The lazy river was so overcrowded and the main pools were a bit too cold to enjoy. The air inside the hotel felt recycled and made our eyes dry and our lips chapped.
plus^The pool that we unfortunately didn't get to use due to the weather.
minus^Broken titles in bathroom stains on floor and shower curtain, got glass in feet from walking in the bathroom, black stains on sheets after paying for an upgrade. We then asked for a different room which they couldn't do. I've stayed here before and loved it so brought my boyfriend here for his birthday and it was our first trip in three years together, I was very bummed out by this experience.
plus^Location was great, also the pool facilities were good.
minus^Didn't like the fact we were given a twin room. Also there was a software upgrade of the computer system which caused problems with checking in and booking certain facilities. The staff were unapologetic for the disruption.
plus^Room was very well furnished and clean and bed comfortable.  The pool area and lazy river is nice though crowded. Check out was easy. Less expensive than most other hotels on the strip
minus^The cost of visiting Vegas has risen enormously - restaurants are generally expensive/poor value now (they were excellent value) and many benefits/attractions have been withdrawn or are charged for ( no coffee in room/charge for tube at pool/ charge for parking/ what happened to the lions?/ charge for monorail etc) The lines at check in were tedious. Parking is a long way from reception. Reception area is slightly tacky. Has the lazy river been shortened since our last stay?
minus^My room was not cleaned for 2 days. I had to ask for it to be cleaned. (It was) I had to go find clean glasses to drink from.  The woman in one of the stores was rude to my friend and I. We had spent the day in the hot and the clerk didn't make the day any better.  We were not able to pay my bill at the end of our stay as the system was uploading. I asked for an emailed receipt but have not received it yet.
plus^The rooms were big and spacious with extra comfortable beds. The hotel was very clean and staff were very helpful. Everything we needed was in the hotel, we didn't end up leaving much. There was numerous restaurants to choose from around the complex, an excellent pool, the casino, the outdoor club for the day time pool parties and the nightclub for the night.
minus^It took ages to check in due to the huge que of people waiting. There should have been more staff on duty to shorten the length of the que.
plus^Fantastic Hotel Location! Great vibe at the hotel and had absolutely everything you would need for a stay in Vegas! Also a great price!
minus^The Buffet was a little average and it's a shame you get charged to use a refrigerator in such a big hotel.
plus^The staff in general specially the front office , concierge  Jhon (guest service who wear green shirts) was very helpful and friendly more over very honest, he gave us full information about vegas and what to do there specially to entertain my young kids
minus^Cleanliness of the room, housekeeping doesn't do their job effectively
plus^Great location. Very clean. Great facilities.
minus^I asked one of the receptionist if he knew where the bus station was and he told me to google it. Housekeepers and security staff were very nice though.
plus^Property really is amazing. Centre of strip main strip just outside door. Loved the fact hakkasan and wet republic entries are in the complex no walking outside it really was brilliant. Def the party place to stay. Casino is massive staff cleaners are top notch. Loved my stay wouldn't say anywhere n Vegas after staying here this time and I have stayed other places in Vegas but this tops it for party vibe
minus^Considering it was LDW Hallways ways were very noisy and u could here everything going on outside the room from inside. Sound proofing ain't great. Wouldn't be ideal for quite nights in party season. 
plus^The location of the hotel and staff within the hotel
minus^When booking it gave me the option to book with a card where the card holders would not be going when arriving at the hotel the refused to take payment from the card and it took two days to sort it
plus^Rooms were large, spa facility was very good, rooms were quiet too.
minus^The cleaners only came in every other day and when they did, it wasn't a great job. The hotel is extremely large so some of the rooms are a good walk away which was fine for me but might not be for others.
plus^The pool complex was amazing, our bed was comfy and nice staff. The Buffet here is a must!
minus^The pillows were too flat, bad lighting in room and no view from a very dirty window. Resort fees are also quite a bit.
plus^We stayed in a stay well suite and loved it. the bed, the air purification, the sheets, the towels.
minus^It would be great if the hotel lobby was smoke free
plus^The beds were super comfy and the pool area was fantastic!  The casino staff were also really great
minus^getting food in the hotel mid-afternoon is limited when you're looking for something affordable but not the food court.
plus^Staff and concierge were very helpful.  Room and bed very comfortable.
minus^Where do I start.  We stayed at this hotel on probably the worst weekend of the year...Labour Day.  The hotel was absolutely the place to go to party if you are between 16 and 25.  There were drunk, underdressed and badly behaved people everywhere.   People running and screaming up and down hallways at night, drunk, and underdressed people in the lobby and casino.  Unfortunately saw young men at the front of the hotel at the main entrances with their shorts down exposing themselves during the middle of the day.  There seemed to be no interest from the hotel of maintaining any standards whatsoever, anything goes at the MGM Grand.  We also had guests trying to enter our room in the early hours, obviously drunk, even had security try to get into our room.  We had to continually tell them to go away.    Location was right at the south end of the strip and you had to either walk or pay for the monorail (which was good). You need to add 30 minutes if you had to attend a show at The Mirage or Bellagio. We didn't enjoy our stay at all and recommend for central location The Mirage or mid-high end luxury Aria, Ceasar's Palace.
plus^Pools, wet republic, bars, hotel has everything you need.
minus^Both my friend and I travel a lot and the reception staff were the RUDEST and most unhelpful employees we have ever come across. The facilities in your room were pretty average, no view and the wifi was not secure. Definitely not value for money once you add the taxes to your total.
plus^Nicely decorated room
minus^This hotel is huge! Took us several hours to checkin and check out, even to get from the room to breakfast takes endless time. Valet parking highly recommended
minus^Nothing special. Choose the other hotels which more central. Too crowded and bot family friendly. Parking is terrible, need valet foe sure. Bell man is not ready to help.
plus^The beds were very comfy and the pillows were great.  The whole experience was outstanding we would return.
minus^We can't think of anything that we didn't like.
minus^This is my first discounted room so that could explain why the quality was not up to the level I expected. The cleanliness was not up to par and it did not have the polished look and feel.  But since I was there for business and the purpose was to have a place to sleep, it was fine.
plus^The room was clean.
minus^The size and confusing layout. It was expensive to stay and eat there. The buffet is overpriced. The West wing looks tired and needs renovations.
plus^This property is old and smells, checking in is a disaster, waited from 1am-2:3-am just to get the keys.  They don't care and there is nothing that they were doing to improve.
minus^Check in, smells - it's the old property, and charges for everything even if you just open a refrigerator without taking anything out!
plus^Nice pillows, very exciting atmosphere
minus^To much smoke, AC in my room did not work correctly last night there. No areas to sit down at like to lounge inside.
minus^I got a room with trash and used towel. The bed was not ready and dirty. We called the customer service, and they were reluctant to help. We waited for near an hour, but no one coming to clean the room as their manager had promised. Finally, we went back to front desk, and got a different room with more difficulties.
minus^Shower in the bathroom leaked every time we took a shower. The view that we had wasn't very appealing. Right as you walk into the room you are in the bathroom. No privacy in bathroom.
plus^Location realty was the only good thing about this hotel.
minus^Communicated with the hotel about it being my husbands birthday, nothing. I had received an email from them to say the information was on the booking. We have stayed before and had much better treatment. Poor customer service and repeat business recognition. Won't be staying again.
plus^Took advantage of genius discount and booked a Spa Suite, well worth paying extra, very large room with great amenities. Plethora of entertainment and food options within the hotel itself, and further options in very close proximity.
minus^Even with the hotel's general fantastic amenities in terms of pools and restaurants I could not give this room full marks, there is no fridge available in the room without paying an extra $25 and there is no in-room coffee maker. I find this very cheap, given even your $30 a night motel will provide these amenities. Given the amount of money the hotel will be making off of guests these should be available in the rooms.
plus^The staff were very helpful and pleasant,prepared to explain the local attractions etc.
minus^Beware the West wing, an area of the hotel which is in need of upgrading. The corridor carpets were dirty. No hot water,despite there being plenty in our son's room next door,pop up waste in sink didn't work,damaged furnishings,all were reported but no action taken. After reporting the lack of hot water again the following morning we were advised to run the shower and the tap at the same time and this worked.  Were given the tax back as compensation. Not impressed!
plus^Valet Parking
minus^WiFi  doesn’t work。Engineer spend about 40 minutes, even can't fixed the problem. We spending about 1 hour to find the check in gate. MGM employee can not tell us clearly how to go to the front desk.  We can not find the exit in the casino on the first floor. Very Bad，No more MGM.
minus^They took out almost 1000 on my card at the front desk on accident so the rest of my trip was terrible because I couldn't get that money back for almost a week. AFTER I was home. So all the money I saved for my trip I couldn't use. When I talked to a man up front he told me I need to deal with it and call my bank. When I demanded for a manager they finally said they were sorry and paid for my valet. Still not enough to cover food, gambling and drinks while I was there.
plus^Excellent stay here. The rooms are huge and are very clean. The resort is massive and quite overwhelming for our first time in Vegas! It took a while to find our way around but we loved the pool area and there were loads of options for food and drink. Our stay included a buffet which we can highly recommend - be hungry before you go though!
minus^We didn't win... maybe next time!
plus^We enjoyed the location of the hotel which is very convenient to discover the Strip
minus^The room sheets weren't really clean, they had stains and you could really see that globally it wasn't really clean for 2 days out of the 5 we stayed.
minus^We were there on our honeymoon and they gave us a double bed room, could not find any single king sized bed in their entire hotel .. instead of apologizing or offer complementary things , instead they tried to sell us an upgrade on our room with no view, lower floor and for 80 more dollars per night! Their only answer was it's your honeymoon so you won't mind squizzing yourselves in a full size bed ! 
minus^The room was far, far too small and toilet amenities non-existent. No in-room coffee-tea machines. No mini-bar. This should have been mentioned while booking the room. In Vegas you normally expect decent sized rooms and amenities mentioned above are standard for any half-decent hotel today.
plus^Cirque du Soleil show incredible experience; Strip view upgrade worth the modest extra bucks; online pre check-in recommended - standard check-in queue was astoundingly long; breakfast at Avenue cafe lovely; restaurant La Fiamma not cheap but excellent
minus^Hotel is packed with crowds from morning to late night, if you like it less beehive-ish consider Bellagio which feels a bit less like a shopping mall and  more like a Hotel; our stay at MGM was good value and pleasant though, we enjoyed it
plus^The location and all the things to do within the complex, you really don't need to leave the place if you don't want to it has everything there.
minus^N/A
plus^The pool area is nice. If you're into gambling, this is a really nice place to play as there are a lot of active tables. 
minus^The room is too dark for my taste. It was a bit small and we didn't like the layout of the room as there wasn't really a separate room for the bathroom. I was a bit disappointed with it considering it was MGM. The layout of the rooms weren't too good as well as we had to walk far to get to the elevators.
minus^This is not a hotel but a factory. I had to stand in line for 30 min before I could check in. Avoid the rooms on the ground floors and the alleys to the casino, they are very noisy
plus^The ambiance, always people around . The check in was great and accommodated our needs  Servers at the buffet are really enjoyable and friendly
minus^They said will be better prices on shows for hotel guest and was a big lie. Pool is really small for all the guest we were there
plus^We stayed in the West Wing Tower and the room and bed were so nice and comfy! The Live Lucky Bar was right by one of the entrances to our tower and it was so fun; we played beer pong and there was pool and giant jenga! We came in a big group so we got a cabana at the pool with the lazy river. That was awesome and our waitress gave great service.
minus^I know it's Vegas and MGM is super nice so my husband and I knew it wasn't going to be cheap, but we really didn't think we'd spend as much money as we did. Everything was just so expensive in my opinion. While beer pong was awesome, paying $38 for a pitcher of Bud Light was not. And drinks at the cabana were $24 each with refills for $17 each. Maybe that's normal for the nice hotels in Vegas, but that was just crazy expensive to us! Also, our friends were staying at the Signature and it was a 20 minute walk from our room in the West Wing to theirs. No exaggeration! Not the hotel's fault of course, but just beware when booking because the resort is huge.
plus^Room was nice..bed totally comfortable. Great price. Friendly staff
minus^It was pretty huge which meant you had to do a lot of walking. Drinks at pool very expensive
plus^The casino, the lobby service and the Hotel architecture.
minus^The room was not spacious and I felt claustrophobic and also the room was dusty.  The little table next to the bed was dusty and the AC was annoying.
plus^Bed was very comfortable and received a free upgrade
minus^The upgrade was on the ground floor with no view apart from a courtyard. It didn't really feel like an upgrade. No mini fridge.
plus^A really lovely hotel! We had a West Wing King room which was modern, clean and with decor of a high standard. The bed was extremely comfortable and the facilities provided were exceptional. The bathroom area was not fully enclosed, although the shower and toilet are are.  This hotel is huge! We got lost a couple of times! One tip is to not follow the signs for the West Wing when looking for West Wing rooms! Ask for directions instead - we got well and truly lost! The hotel had a good, vibrant atmosphere. There was a food hall for those who do not want to use the restaurants on site which provided fast service. It's a good location as right at the start of the Strip but be warned the Strip is huge, like most things in Vegas. We really enjoyed being here and would thoroughly recommend it.
minus^Just be aware that the hotel hold $100 per night on a credit card to cover incidentals. There is also tax, city tax and resort fees to be added to the Booking.com room price. This will be on your booking confirmation but can be easy to forget!!
minus^Stayed at the MGM for the third time and this was the best trip yet. We had one of the stay well rooms and it was definitely what I needed. The beds are better, air quality was better and overall just had a great experience
minus^This was our first time to Las Vegas and this hotel is right in the middle of EVERYTHING! Transportation to the airport and beyond the strip are super easy as they ALWAYS have taxis lined up!
plus^The best swimming pool I've ever seen!!!Especially Lasy River! Awsome!!! 
minus^Very very very dirty room! I've never been in such dirty room!!! We found under beds plastick sticks, m&ms, papers, plastick knife and... Used condom!!!!!! Terrible!!!! Window was dirty. Long waiting for hot water in bathroom. One small schampoo for 4 people for 2 days! And we found in bathroom towel with big hole!!!! What we get from the hotel as excuse? Canceling hotel fee. Those acommodations should cost 0$!!! 
plus^Not too many things except that it was on the strip.
minus^Property smells badly . Overcrowded and unfriendly staff. Charge you for every little bit from every corner.
minus^The room was located all the way in the west wing so it was not the main building and apparently the west wing are cheaper rooms anyway so the value was overall not great considering it was anknockoff MGM
plus^Large hotel with lots of amenities, close to airport. Good quality furnishings in the room itself. 
minus^Felt a bit like it was 'spring break' on the weekend particularly in the pool area. food seemed expensive, atm fees were ridiculous in the hotel itself ($8.00 or more). We were given a room on the 4th floor which only had a view of the lower roof with all the air con motors on it. I assume it because we booked a cheap rate via the booking.com website. This meant there was a constant drone at night when trying to sleep... 
plus^Huge complex with a lot to do inside. You really don't have to leave the premises unless you of course want to see something else as well. Very busy, but so are all the big resorts on along the Strip.
minus^A lot of extra fees that are not included in the Booking.com price. Read the small print and prepare yourself that the price will be higher than you may expect. Limited number of shades/umbrellas available around the pool area. Gets super hot during the day.
plus^Pools especially lazy river
minus^No coffee or tea in the room. Have to stand one hour in the line each morning to get coffee. The refrigerator guidance unclear.
plus^Very good check in and check out on line system. Modern room with elegant style. The room was clean but too dark. Location is great. 
minus^No bottle of water in the room. No fridge. Minimum services. Parking fees  12 dollars per day on top of the room and resort fees. 
plus^It was just about the Location, which was perfect and close to most of the attractions at the strip. Also, you will find variety of restaurants nearby.
minus^The attitude of the staff at the reception during the check-in was totally not as per the expectation to reflect hotel’s reputation. I personally did not feel convenient from the staff and the way their attitude was. Cleanliness was another big concern and question mark, room was totally outdated, and the pathway was very dirty, way too dirty!! It was an experience for the first time, and would be the last time for me.
plus^Room was clean and modern, beds are lovely and comfortable, huge hotel with plenty of restaurants and shows.
minus^We were asked for 100 dollar deposit per night as well as payment on a credit card upfront. We were not allowed split payment on 2 cards (twin room with two guests) which was an inconvenience. They did accept payment on debit card after some discussion.
plus^The room was basic with very low lighting. Could be very noisy from other guests in the early hours. I was disappointed with the overall experience of the hotel.
minus^As above
plus^It's the best location to stay at because it's located right in the middle of Las Vegas. Plus there are tons of restaurants to eat at.
minus^The walk from the parking garage to our hotel was so far away. I personally didn't mind as much because I enjoyed the workout, but for some it would drive them crazy.
minus^They had carts of food that was left out from the hotel guests from the night before filling the halls. They were out all day long so we had to look at and smell old food all day! Unacceptable 
minus^Fantastic stay at Las Vegas, and our choice of MGM was a good one. Very busy place and this is what we were looking for. It is also quit convenient as all the major shows are in the hotel and nearby. The only somewhat negative note is the quality of the service which sometime falls behind, in particular at the bars of the hotel - however, very good service at restaurants including Wolfgang Puck restaurant, Emirylls, etc.
plus^I love MGM hotel, the pool, casino and club/bars are all great
minus^The room was very dark and didn't have a fridge. It had a massive walk in cupboard - a small fridge could have easily been put in there
plus^Huge hotel with huuuuge corridors. Full of shops and restaurants. Nice pool....and oh yeah, theres a casino :D :D
minus^The pool should close later. There should be a shuttle to the airport less expensive and not just one per hour.
plus^Bed was great and room was well-appointed.
minus^My shower wasn't working properly and water came out of it in a light pressure. The water was also spewing out of the tub spout the entire time of the shower and I tried everything to get it to work.
plus^The MGM was very comfortable and the swimming pool was great. It had every possible thing that you could want or need - as long as you were willing to pay for it. We had a problem with our shower on our first night and they dealt with this very well the next morning upgrading us to a better room
minus^Everything in the hotel is very expensive - for example $5.50 for a small water in the hotel shop. The hotel is so big that it's easy to feel lost and like just another number in a never ending cycle.
plus^Great service from Yessenia on reception who was very helpful accommodating me and my friends. Great location but also includes everything you need inside the hotel.
minus^Nothing
plus^The Brad Garrett comedy club show was excellent and so was the food and the staff. The pool area is outstanding.
minus^They did not hold our room even though I told them about the late check in. I had to change rooms the next day.
plus^The bed was very comfy. I really, really, like the buffet and all the recreational stuff.
minus^The bathroom had issues toilet handle was broken the whole time we stated there. The shower head was broken the whole time we stated there. We had to switch rooms at least twice.
plus^We like the pool.
minus^The television is on when we opened the room and trash still in the trash box. The room was smell cigarette but we reserved non- smoking room.           It looks like someone just check out and the maid didn't complete thier job.
plus^Beautiful and Clean rooms
minus^The place is huge.... needs more seating in common areas throughout.  The only places to sit were at the slot machines or in a restaurant.  I suffered an accident to my toe outside waiting on a cab and had to HOP/LIMP all the way to the elevators and up to my room.   MORE SEATING IS NEEDED!
plus^Room was clean and comfortable
minus^MGM felt a a bit unclean around hotel. Would have liked facility to make drinks in room given the price. Hotel was overpriced really. Personally I felt it was too big, kept getting lost and you couldn't just pop to pool etc.
plus^The pool facilities were very nice and the fact that they were open early and late was great. Your electronic check in was great, we didn't have to wait to long. My time is valuable to me.
minus^Room cleanliness, we found someone else's dirty socks under the nightstand while we were searching for the TV remote, which was gone and had to be replaced. We called house keeping, the supervisor came up and told us that it would be a few hours before they could get the room cleaned. The mirror in the bathroom was never cleaned for the four days that we were there. there was not enough staff, housekeeping, waitresses, etc. The resort fee, for the WiFi, & the pool. Well the WiFi doesn't work very well, and for the amount of money they collect, there should be more, and cleaner washroom facilities around the pool. All my family members had to wait in line to use the washroom. The hotel cafe is very expensive for the type of average food they serve, and the service is horrible. I went for breakfast with my Daughters, I had an appointment so we told the waitress we were in a hury, we ordered right away. I ordered steak n eggs, they each ordered pancakes and fruit cups. When the food came, my steak was well done, I ordered medium. There was only one waitress for about fifteen tables at breakfast rush. It took twenty minutes to get her attention  again. She apologized and said she would get it replaced right away. Twenty more minutes later the girls were done and l still didn't have any breakfast. We got up to leave and asked for the bill, then my food came. I told them to keep it.  My bill for two orders of pancakes, two fruit cups two glasses of OJ, and tea for me was over $40.  The MGM is supposed to be a five star resort, well I've stayed at three star resorts in third world counties that are cleaner, with better service, and better staff. I have also stayed at the Luxor, also a MGM resort and experienced the same as above, an unclean, poorly staffed hotel, and the pool there closed at 6 pm. I will probably not stay at an MGM resort again.
plus^The Valet and Bellman were very nice. All of the staff in encountered seemed very nice.
minus^The check in process took 30 minutes standing in line. The hallways near our room smelled of dirty and dusty air.
plus^Fantastic hotel, staff where great. 
minus^Joining rooms have no sound insulation measures on the adjoining door. Meaning you can hear your neighbours very easily. 
plus^The hotel was great hotel, I didn't have a lot of problems but I had some. But for the most part it was good.
minus^I didn't like that they charge us $100 a night for fees plus we had to pay the resort fee. But nobody told us that we had to pay $100 a night to hold on a credit card. So they just nickel and dime you that way.
plus^The swimming pool
minus^Queues were terrible after long flight to book in.,1Hour at reception  Bottle of water & snickers bar at the shop in reception 12 dollars disgusting Rooms very dated not worth the money Nobody has a clue what's going on in there hotel they work in ,pretty poor for a hotel for  £100 & resort fee biggest rip off ,go to America every year all over the states such a big disappointment in LasVagas  .Booked at the Vidara as well through yourself the week before better experience ,this facilities tax is such a rip off Booking .com Hav to come clean with all those different taxes when getting over to Las Vegas !!! In the Vidara they wanted an extra 45 dollars for the sun beds with green cushions it was a disgrace!! Could Hav bought a set of cushions taking liberties out on people ! Must Must start making things a lot clearer £ 35 tax a day plus £35 a day for cushions not good enough add that up over 1Week £ 490 for a tax appalled !!!
plus^Bed and pillows were extremely comfy. Staff were very helpful and pleasant.
minus^Swimming Pool closed at 8pm, which is later than some other hotels but still with the hot weather in August, closing at 10pm would have been nice.
plus^The room was fine for us.  It was good to be in a non-smoking hotel.  Beds were comfortable. It was good to be able to get two queen beds for a reasonable rate.
minus^The bar scene wasn't my thing.  It takes forever to get from one place to another in this hotel/casino!  To a newcomer, it can be overwhelming.
plus^The staff was very friendly and welcoming. The room and bathroom were extremely clean and was beautifully designed. It was quiet and peaceful which was a pleasant surprise when we remembered we were vacationing in Las Vegas. The beds were comfortable and carpet was spotless. The accessibility to the lobby, casino, and dining areas were very convenient. Overall, it was a wonderful weekend with no real complaints. 
minus^Our room was given away and we were reaccomedated to a different part of the hotel. It's always been a little frustrating to know that you are told your reservation secures your booking but this still happens. Unfortunately, there is also no housekeeping that will come in to straighten up or provide new toiletries and such unless you pay extra. All other hotels I've been to, have provided this service at no extra fee. 
plus^Nice hotel - nice and busy casino
minus^Really needs updating! Rooms were okay - the BIGGEST issue was that we had cold water for the entire trip and stay at MGM and they didn't do anything to correct it. So - that sucked.
plus^It's a massive hotel like a mini resort
minus^Very expensive water - 6.5 dollars a bottle! From the tuck shop downstairs, and very expensive restaurants! Beware!
plus^My daughter and I enjoyed the pool area.  It was vast and fun.
minus^Unfortunately our room was positioned next to a large dumpster area located in the rear of the building adjacent to our room.  The situation became even more undesirable after the MGM staff proceeded to increase their garbage dumping activities throughout the night.   Additionally the room appeared worn and tired.  I observed large cracks in the walls and paint peeling from the ceiling in the bathroom.  And lastly, my daughter stated that her bed mattress was extremely hard leading to a very uncomfortable sleep.  Unfortunately, I also experienced this issue as well.  All of these factors have contributed to a realization of never staying at the MGM hotel again.
plus^We've stayed at this property before and it is always clean, safe and has all the amenities one needs to have a great holiday. Staff is always helpful and friendly as well.
minus^Location is a little South on the strip so you have to walk quite a distance to see some of the other attractions up the strip. Normally not an issue but when it's 42C it's a long walk.  Otherwise nothing really to complain about.
plus^Spacious rooms, ample eating & drinking options, great pools
minus^Towards the top of the strip which can be a bit of a difficult walk in the heat down towards the centre of the strip
plus^Me and my Partner enjoyed the pool very much had a blast and the strip was very nice at night was a excellent night at MGM we would definitely stay again for sure.
minus^More days spent at thee hotel would've been spectacular.
minus^I asked for view and when I got to my room I faced the back with the air units .. it was suppose to be a surprise for my daughters 21st Bday .. very disappointed
plus^The hotel itself was amazing, great food mall, casino, and amazing pool area... good location and staff did a great job at keeping transport flowing so there was no waiting about on taxis...
minus^The room we wer in was a non smoking room but had a really bad smell of smoke... not sure if it was coming tru the vents but it was annoying wen myself and partner don't smoke....
plus^The rooms were updated and very nice. The staff was very helpful, we had a problem with the tv and it was resolved in 15 minutes.
minus^The parking garage was hard to find.
plus^Easy taxi access and monorail.
minus^Shower head and downspout did not function properly. Noisy room we could hear every time the blinds and door were opened and closed in room next to us. The room smelled like cigarettes.
plus^Jeepett - the woman who checked us in at reception was wonderful. Very friendly and helpful. I hope her manager receives this message and Jeepett is recognised for her work.  We were upgraded to Queen Tower room which was a good gesture as there was a problem with our mobile check in.  Pool area was great.  The bed was very comfortable.
minus^Wifi was very slow and kept dropping out.  The walls in our room were thin and we could hear everything happen in the room next to ours. Also the windows aren't double glazed so we could hear outside noise even though we were 23 floors up. We were very surprised by the lack of sound proofing. We were never offered drinks when gambling. We would have been happy to pay even though complimentary drinks while gambling is suppose to be offered. However there were very few waiters on the floor and we just couldn't get their attention. In the end we stopped gambling and went to the bar to buy a drink. We probably would have continued playing if we could have got a drink.  We did a mobile check in 24 hours before we were due to arrive but when we got to hotel our check in had not been processed. We arrived an hour after our nominated check in time and well over 24 hours since doing the mobile check in. It was very disappointing that it hadn't been processed.
minus^All I'm gonna say is front desk clerk carmen I think from Mexico. That's what she had under her name. NOTHING SHORT OF AMAZING. This woman totally went way way above the call of duty. She doesn't belong behind that front desk.
plus^Large room which was clean and well furnished.
minus^Hotel is just too big. Too long to get anywhere including to car park. Restaurants expensive. Everything is packed with people. Half hour queue at In house Starbucks for a morning coffee.
plus^Good location, great that you can hop on the monorail within the MGM. Multiple food options. Easy access to the strip.
minus^MGM pools and Wet Republic did not offer glasses of water. If you did not want to pay $20+ for a bottle of water, they gave you a cup and pointed you to the water fountain. This was a mess to say the least at Wet Republic. There was a huge line at all times which was right in front of the restrooms and made it hard to get anywhere. You had to wait in line for 10+ minutes to get a small cup of water and one of the fountains wasn't working. Not okay that you have hundreds of people in one venue when its 110+ degrees and not provide easy and convenient access to water.
plus^The room was very sacious amazing view of the strip! Room was too small instantly upgraded our room!
minus^Aircon wasnt working fully but was instantly resolved
plus^Even though it's been there for some time, it still looks and feels up-to-date. Overall clean. Great pool area, with fun lazy river, which does get crowded as the day progresses. Not very good with very little children.
minus^Like most places in Las Vegas, it's massive. It takes a day or two to know how to navigate efficiently. Indications and routing could be better.
plus^Central locatuon of the property
minus^The lack of privacy when you open the room door. The bathroom is the first thing you see when you walk in so you will be exposed if you are getting out of the shower when the door opens.
plus^Very comfort room, hotel's pool is great.
minus^Had a problem with the light in the shower that wasn't fixed in the two days we've spent there. They did refund us some money, but still this had a bad impact on the overall experience. The hotel is *very* big and it's easy to get lost there. It takes a lot of time to go from one facility to the other and it all goes through the casino. For a none gambler, that's an issue.
plus^Casino is good and choice of food and hakkasan.
minus^View from the room was shocking. We bought a strip view room and literally got dumped on the 5th floor with no view. Showers are rubbish. Also they took a $300 deposit without telling us off my card and said it won't go back on for another 30 days!!!!
plus^Room was very good, comfortable bed. Excellent outside pool areas. Great facilities inside and outside of resort.
minus^View from room not facing towards strip.
plus^Stayed at this hotel many times over the last 10 years and still great! Pool area one of the best in Vegas and we have stayed at another 6 hotels on the strip. Hotel had another refurbishment a few years ago and still looks fab. Stayed in a Grand King Room again and would recommend this type over West Wing rooms. West Wing if your on a tight budget., but for the difference I'd avoid. Internet is fast. We always return as the pool area is the best!
minus^This hotel now charges for parking @ $10 a day and it can be a struggle to find a space!! Another scam a Vegas hotel finds to take your hard earned cash from your pocket. I would expect all MGM group hotels on the strip have followed suit and there are many. The usual resort fee of $40 a day is also added to your bill. Nice!  The worst part of staying at the MGM grand has and appears that it will always be the check-in process. They are happy to leave you standing the for 1-2 hours and then think smiling and saying sorry for your wait in some way should make everything ok! During check-in the staff are nice, but just talk c**p. It is a sales pitch, trying to get you to upgrade. After 2 hours at the airport and 30 minutes to the hotel you ready don't need 1-2 hour check-in. They even know how bad they are at checking people in as they provide water for the people waiting, you know, just in case you pass out!!!! They now offer an online check-in and we only found out after a few days as it is not well known. Online check-in could be the future!!!
plus^Beds were super comfy and soft. The pool outside was super clean and well managed. It was a really enjoyable experience with brilliant music and good food/drink. The KA Show was amazing. I highly recommend it! You barely need to leave the hotel it's so amazing with food, haircare and music to suit everyone!
minus^It was a very long walk to the buffet from our room but it was enhanced by the casino experience along the way. If honest, the hotel needs a little work on the carpet and furnishings of the casino area, but what casino doesn't!
plus^Nothing
minus^My entire MGM Grand experience was terrible. I will never stay at the hotel again, nor will I recommend this hotel to anyone. I paid almost 2,000$ for 5 night stay for a very small room with no accommodations, a window view to a concrete wall, and the entrance leading to the dark hallway is very difficult to locate. There is a 12$ fee now for parking. Everyday at least one of the escalators did not work. I visit Las Vegas often and never have I had such a terrible time. I will make sure to tell all friends and family members about my experience to make sure they never visit MGM Grand
plus^facilities , cleaning and overall hotel
minus^My aircondition was not working well. I called the maintenance to send someone but no one showed up so I called again few hours later and they sent a technician who finally came and said he fixed it. The issue was not resolved and I called twice again but no one came to help. I went then to the reception to complain. They said they can only move me to a similar room with working aircondition but the room will be very far from the lobby and i have to help myself with this.
plus^The hotel rooms were spacious and location was on the strip.
minus^The hotel rooms were spacious but very basic, lacked even basic amenities such as coffee machine or a hot water kettle which are common today even in a 2 star hotel. The shower hardly had any water pressure and the bathtub drainage was extremely slow making water to accumulate while taking a shower. When we asked room service to provide hot water for baby milk we were told it will cost 30$ to hire the electric kettle. There was a note mentioning that if you put anything in the fridge in the room this will cost 50$ and if one needs to keep something in the fridge then one needs to hire place in common fridges with house keeping which will cost 25$. The casino in the nearby hotels is also much more happening. Even though we had a run of the house booking but we were still not upgraded even though there were other options available, we were told that they would cost extra, what is the point of booking run of the house if the hotel provides their most basic room, it would have been better that I had booked a room category myself where I could choose between multiple other hotels for the same price range. This hotel might have been one to stay in once upon a time but now there are better options.
plus^The pool area was amazing!
minus^At check in the lady asked me if I booked with booking.com and when I said I did she replied with you will be in the west wing then. She gave me the impression that because we didn't book with the hotel directly that we got a room which was of a lower standard. It was the last room at the end of a very long corridor. I appreciate that the hotel is huge and that there will be a long walk to your room regardless of where you are located. Overall, she gave me the impression that as I did not book directly my custom was less appreciated. There was only one tiny window in the room and as a result the room was very dark. I was disappointed with how basic the room was and for the price was overall disappointed. The room was fine but had very few extras e.g fridge and there was a shelf stuck together with tape. I had expected so much more of the MGM but unfortunately my expectations were not met.
plus^Fabulous location and such a large hotel!
minus^Checking in and out was SO long - don't expect a quick check in as we arrived at 1am at night and it still took 45 minutes!
plus^MGM cabana by the lazy river service was great
minus^It was our wedding celebration weekend and the front desk staff was not very nice to us when we asked him questions about upgrades and restaurant/club options on the property.
plus^An upgrade to a stay well room, gave us an extra nice bed and great lighting and pleasant smell. Swimming area is really nice, a lazy river and pools enough with great service. terrific restaurants in the hotel. Almost a shame to go somewhere else.
minus^the automated minibar doesn't state clear on your bill, a bit confusing and your unable to check.
plus^Resort was awesome
minus^Comfort of the rooms pillows terrible, Motion Airconditioning SUCKS!!!!! The air conditioning only works by motion... WHAT... Rooms We're hot all night every night because your sleeping!!! I see this as a value during the day but at night it was horrible....
plus^Bellhops were so nice and informative. They acted as if they genuinely wanted to help us have a good time. The room was clean and we had a great view. The day we spent at the pool was so fun. I've always wanted to order lunch poolside.
minus^The only thing I didn't like was the horrible cigarette smell...albeit brief, as we walked through the casino.
plus^Nice location and friendly staff
minus^West Wing King room was very disappointing. No view, felt like there was no window (a small one with no view was hid behind two different curtains). No minibar or fridge, no separate bathroom, only shaded glass doors for shower and toilet cubicles. At $250 per night this is terrible value for money. Since we were so disappointed we called front desk to ask if any upgrades were available which they weren't. Will not book again.
plus^Came in to a hot room after an hour check in process! Called twice after waiting an hour and Maintenance didn't know when they were able to come up. I was leaving in the morning so I was not about to wait in the room all night for them. Didn't want them in the room while I was gone either. Overall just a bad experience. I Wouldn't pay to stay at the MGM ever again.
minus^Customer service, hotels inability to accommodate to a large number bet of customers checking in- over an hour wait all day, and I arrived at 7pm!!
plus^The room was clean. Housekeeping staff friendly and accommodating.
minus^The room was too small. Our view was of an another building about 30 feet away. The shelves in the bathroom were too small for appliances. Sink was not draining properly. Very little room to relax in the room. I would not and will not recommend the MGM to family and friends.  Overpriced for a very inadequate room.
plus^Staff and attention to detail is unbelievable at the MGM. We stay here to visit all the great culinary treats (Joel Rubuchon, Morimoto, Crafsteak, etc) but also because it's consistently well-managed. I don't really think twice about where to book since I know it's worth even a few extra hundred dollars to make sure everything will be just right.
minus^Room furniture could use an update. FIX THE WALKWAY TO NEW YORK NEW YORK or provide a quick and fast method to access T-Mobile without walking in 115 degree heat in tailored clothing! Please.
plus^Great pool area. Enjoyed the KA show in-house very much
minus^One hour line to check in. Room in the lower north tower with view on the maintenance facilities. Had to pay the resort fee twice every day because our family had two interconnected rooms.
minus^Everything was exelante except I thought since I got a room it was free parking and when I got my bill I was chargered $12.00 also I was taxed 3 different times who dose this that's not cool
plus^The bed was very comfortable and the casino was better than most.
minus^The price booking shows in half the price you actually pay. I am aware of tax addition etc, but I went from a booking for £206 to paying $800 - they take a $300 security deposit - which wasn't mentioned anywhere. As well as the resort fee - so you don't actually get free wifi you are paying for it. The whole place is a rip of. Room service trolleys filled our corridor and were left there for two days. Rude staff - which I understand theres a lot of people in Vegas and can be stressful, but they are seriously rude! Parking is expensive and the pool very underwhelming.
plus^Great hotel with beautiful rooms, very spacious and luxurious. Handy mobile check-in helped us skip the line and move into our room a lot faster. Good location at the start of the strip was perfect.
minus^No interaction with staff whatsoever because of mobile check-in and check-out so no welcome, no recommendations, we basically had to find our own way.  Paying a resort fee for not using any of the 'promised' facilities is just borderline criminal: we didn't use the wi-fi, the pool or any of the other things every other hotel in the world doesn't charge you for, and that just leaves you with a bad feeling.
plus^The bed was a little uncomfortable but everything else was perfect
minus^The bed . For the money I paid I wanted to be sleeping on a cloud not a thin mattress
plus^We were in 3 rooms in total. The 3rd room that we ended up in was very nice.
minus^The first room we were in hadn't been cleaned. We were moved to a second room, and the key did not get reassigned electronically. Security was sent to open the door. This second room was also problematic because it smelled like cigarettes, even though the hotel is non smoking. The third room was good, and was what I expected in the first place.
plus^Use mobile check-in and out to avoid the lines and get to the pool when it opens at 8am to find some nice shaded spots before the lazy river starts at 9am. If you're a light sleeper people coming and going in the hallway may bother you, but it is Vegas!
minus^A little run down and our room had an underlying smoky smell (West Wing Grand Tower). Overall not a bad place to stay, just don't touch the minibar - don't physically even touch any items!! They are all weighted (drinks, chips etc) and you will be charged per item plus a $50 restocking fee. Apparently there is around a 60 second timer once they've been lifted. If you want to keep anything cold use the ice machine in the hallway, not the fridge! Our charges were reversed after a call to reception (they were very understanding) however then appeared again as a seperate charge on the credit card a few days after checkout (another phone call fixed this).
minus^There was a problem with our wifi - we got an upgrade and a free rental fridge to compensate for the inconvenience, which wasn't that inconvenient anyway 😎
plus^It was clean  Rooms smoke-free
minus^Parking location was far from lobby (it was super hot out) Check in staff was unyielding and indifferent (some check in issues and they weren't very helpful) Room was far from everything
minus^We paid a lot of money for this night and we got a small room in the old building, no hot water in the room, no window in the room. All the pools got shut down on Saturday noon!!!!!!   We never will come back again!!!
plus^Excellent location and so much do do. Pool  , night club and shows are top Class 
minus^Prices in the hotel for basics like water  and suncream are horrendous. Disappointed there was no fridge to keep things cool
plus^We hated it ! never be back again , all they wanted to do was over charge us on anything! And because we booked thru you that would not honor any of our free coupon meals ! You could write your name in the dust on the table and we found drugs (pills) on night stand no one knew where they came from . I did not like that we booked they third party 
minus^Nothing about it 
plus^Huge hotel, many facilities. 
minus^Room was half clean when we arrived, we called down reception and they said they'd fix it. They didnt. But old and grotty, but it's vegas! If you're looking for a treat or a proper luxury stay I'd recommend the Bellagio or Caesars Palace. They also charged our card $500 extra, but promptly corrected their error after we called and told them. 
plus^The bed the bathroom
minus^Not having a mini fridge and the walls are too thin. Extremely long check in line.  lack of signage throughout hotel helping people find routes to activities. At the pool we were surprised about how old the music was. The songs were 6 or 7 years old and I think the MGM should allow night swimming and use the beautiful torches they have to up the wow factor.
plus^The place is affordable for Vegas and it's easy to get to from anywhere in town. The hotel also has great amenities.
minus^Thin walls between rooms. You can hear people partying in other rooms.
plus^The bed & pillows were comfy
minus^No fan in the bathroom. The fact that you had to purchase inner tubes for the lazy river. This is the only place I have EVER stayed that you had to purchase a float. All (& I do mean ALL) other places I've stayed has supplied (not rented & not purchased) the inner tubes.
plus^room was nice.
minus^charged $12 a day for parking. Overpriced food and drinks, twice the price of other casinos. Lazy river was so crowded with rude people it ruined the experience.
plus^Staff was very responsive when we had problems with the internet, tv and needed soap. Amount of food options on property was very nice. Location to monorail.  The ease of check in check out online. Felt very safe part of town.
minus^I requested a nice room on a high floor since this was the first time we visited Las Vegas and we are celebrating my son's birthday/8th grade graduation.  We got a room on the lowest floor facing a wall of a part of hotel.  Seems guests of hotel should of be offered a discounted parking rate in garage compared to public parking rate. We were charged $10 for a minibar item my husband touched but did not take.
plus^The fact I switched to another property.
minus^Customer service is nonexistent at this hotel. Since they have so many guest they do not care to makeup for the major mistakes that guest encounter during their stay.
plus^Amazing swimming pool complex. Close to the airport. Within walking distance of other hotels, casinos and entertainment in the strip. Monorail stop in the hotel. Lots of eating options within and around the hotel. Can check out using your in room TV to save time.
minus^Lots of smokers inside the building! Some rooms beginning to look a bit dated (and have a musty smell). Buffet is very expensive and although tasty, desserts weren't that impressive.
plus^Big Room, lots to do, close to airport.
minus^I got an email that I missed asking me to confirm my reservation a while after I booked, that I missed as I get lots of emails.  This cause some problems.  I wish once I book and reserve that it could be final to save this hassle.
plus^Location
minus^Noise level was unbelievable, we needed tow days to rest as we got no sleep. AC unit ran 24/7 and did cool properly. No fridge, ice was gone and parking cost $20 a day.
plus^Check in was quick despite long lines and the staff was helpful checkout was superb as u can just checkout from your tv.or kiosk in the lobby dont need to wait again  bathroom and room size was bigger then normal with nicely decorated
minus^No water or coffee in the room thats was un acceptable..
minus^The air conditioner in the room wasn't working as good as I would have liked it to work. I set the thermostat for 67 and the room never got colder than 73.
plus^I hate it .worst hotel in this world never have such a bad experience
minus^I didn't like anything.my key card was not working have to wait for 1hour for tonehe new whole family waiting in the corridor.pothetic dirty rooms.bad housekeeping
plus^Avenue Cafe was awesome for breakfast, lots of choices hearty portions for an affordable price!
minus^The mattress hasn't been flipped in quite awhile. The shower was small, Cost effective no frills option for the younger crowd mediocre view. Noisy from the nearby airport
plus^The size of the room was great as were the staff.
minus^We were on a non smoking level in a non smoking room but all we could smell was cigarette smoke in our room, it was horrible!
plus^Got a nice breakfast the next day
minus^Too hot and air conditioning noisy. Enormous queues to book in. Too big. Why do I have to pay a resort fee when all I want is bed and breakfast?
plus^Super comfortable bed, nice, big, spacious room. Excellent location, able to find many things to do without having to leave the property! The in-house Cirque de Soleil show is amazing, with free backstage tours available daily. There are plenty of restaurants to choose from in the hotel property ranging from $ to $$$$. Something for everyone! Excellent customer service in that my shower-head was broken, I went down to the check in desk to speak to someone, and while I was looking at the length of the line, another employee came over to me and asked if she could help with anything. I told her what the problem was, she took all the info down and when I returned, my showered had been replaced. Thank you! Going further, you are able to catch the Monorail with ease and go anywhere you want on the Strip!
minus^It took a long time to check in, the customer service agent kept having to go back and forth to the manager on duty to ask him something. I was never informed of what the problem was, but did receive a room upgrade. It would be nice to be given a map or some information upon check in about what services are available and what is offered at the hotel. You will find out by exploring, of course, but it is always exciting to get a taste at check in!
plus^Super convenient, great pools and restaurants.  Our booked room was not ready upon our arrival, so the front desk upgraded us to a better room at no charge.  excellent service!
minus^Because we booked through book it, (a third party vendor) the dollar amount spent on the room was not credited to our M-Life rewards program.   That turned out to be a significant dollar amount and cost us dearly.  Next time we will book through the hotel directly in order to collect credit for the money we spend on the room.
plus^The property was clean. 
minus^Our hotel room was not as nice like I had been told it would be when I was convinced to upgrade. The tile worry was glues together in the shower, the air conditioning only worked sometimes, etc.
plus^Not much. Old room and old equipments. But the gym was good enough, at least.
minus^I reserved 4 nights there, the total price was 400$ us. They said they can upgrade to a bigger room for only 30$ per night, no added fees. I ended up paying a bill of 800$ us. The room and equipments are old, so not worthy the price! I am very disaspointed about the property.
plus^Great hotel.  MGM is one of the best.  Great room prices and value for your money regarding rooms and entertainment.
minus^Food court prices out of control.  Need better food court options.  Wendy's, Taco Bell, Burger King, Shake shack, literally anything better than the current options.  Also 6.87 for a slice of pizza...nuts.
minus^Flew in early and left our luggage with the bell desk.  They informed us that they would call once our room was ready.  Was glad to get that call earlier than expected and check-in was a breeze through the mobile check-in option.   Pool area offered many choices.  Enjoyed our stay!
plus^The pool facility, especially the lazy river, was perfect for my family.
minus^Smoking is more prevalent in public places.  But that's everywhere in Las Vegas.
plus^Great beds. Clean room. Beautiful pools, especially for early risers like ourselves. Pools didn't get crowded until mid day and by then our 3 to 4 hours of poolside sun was plenty. Adult pool (with umbrella) for an extra $25 per person was a nice one day treat that we'll do again. We would usual retire to the poolside restaurant a bit after mid-day for some excellent light food, shade and misters. Later, the indoor spa finished us off. Three day $60 spa package well worth it for steam, sauna, whirlpool, quiet room, spa water, amenities and toiletries. Great variety of restaurants on site. Emeril's had a superb $48 four course meal where you could choose from 3 salads, 3 appetizers, 3 entrees and 3 deserts. Everyting was great, but the banana cream pie was incredible. Great price, great atmosphere, fantastic food.
minus^Parking and then accessing the hotel was a bit of a trek through the many layered, hot parking structure. The lack of  MGM hotelsignage for our initial entry and bag drop was tricky and required an extra lap around the block before we figured it out. An MGM card (pearl or highter) added free parking for our stay. Nice perk!
minus^The room wasn't cleaned well  and the pool area was dirty. The casino area was very smoky compared to other casinos. I wouldn't chose the hotel again I would stay somewhere more central around the Bellagio
plus^Loved the nightclub and Pools
minus^The west wing is run down I almost tripped on the carpet it's a lawsuit waiting the happen the concise services have no clue what they are doing, poor customer service, poor knowledge of amenities, not friendly, not willing the answer questions. The hotel does not honor deals advertised on the hotel website when you book  with a third party.
plus^Thank you for finally coming to fix the television! Took a few days but we still appreciate a t.v. for many reasons. News local weather music etc..
minus^We were without any television services for a few days. We had to cancel reservations in order to be in the room when your t.v. man came to hook up your television. It took days.
minus^Me and my husband we greeted to a stained toilet, which also seem to have hair on the seat. The towels were stained with some type of orange make as large as my hand.  We decided to dine at the MGM Buffet, which i don't recommend based on how they clean there dishes.  HOW are you going to offer an all you can eat and drink with dirty dishes???? I personally grabbed a cup from the stand with lipstick on it. It was horrible.
plus^Large Comfortable rooms. Good selection of Bars and Restaurants throughout the resort.
minus^Lazy River Pool closes too early at 6pm all other pools at the resort don't close until 9pm. Last year when we visited MGM grand, floating pool loungers were available to rent, now you must purchase them $24. Resort Fee too expensive at $39.65 per night.
minus^The charge for parking. I don't think residents should pay. That's something I wasn't a fan of but overall I enjoyed my stay. Will be back!
plus^How large the hotel was with so many activities to choose from. For example the pools/top golf/ shows etc.
minus^Poor security, allowing unsolicited people within the area offering illegal goods and getting in the way of the slots/tables
plus^I love the MGM lazy pool, the very many restaurant options that they have and of course the Casino. I love how the lobby area feels grand and safe. I love that they hold your bags if you get in early or if you leave late. I absolutely loved it when we checked in 2 hours early and they had a room available for us.
minus^I hated the standard room. Please upgrade for your own comfort. The room that we had was dark, mold like smell(wet carpet) and the toilet/ bathroom handles were barely hanging on. The bathroom literally reminded me of boarding showers. I had to wear my slippers in there as the floor was rough and not that clean. There was a hole in the back of the bed and the mattress was not cloud like. The spacing between headboard and mattress was an eyesore as it looked as if it had not been cleaned In years. The pillows were probably from years back and hand me down from the nicer rooms. They had completely lost their fluff. I could not wait to leave. BTW, the bath towels and towelettes are in the toilet so make sure you get that before you step into the shower...you'll see what I mean when you check in.  Overall, avoid standard room and get an upgrade If possible. Also, if you're expecting a view, this room is not it. Plus you can barely see outside. You'll rely more on lighting in the room than natural lighting. The cleaning staff was friendly, from what I saw in the hallway, but the front desk people were not as friendly. If he had only presented the options for an upgrade... this might be a different post. All he said was I booked a standard room. I assumed a standard hotel room... this was not it. It seemed like we were in a motel.
minus^That we could not use the refrigerators that were advertised and there was no microwave. The lighting in the room was poor as well. Not worth the money spent.
plus^Love the buffet staff
minus^Walls are too thin   next room guy bang at my door asking me to turn down my music.  He was ABle to hear my phone speakers (spotify)  from the bathroom all the way to his room.
plus^Clean room and great pool.
minus^View from room overlooked gravel roof with bright lights on it that made it impossible to leave the window open at night and sleep.
plus^Excellent customer service
minus^TOO BIG amd TOO MUCH $$.Parking costs how much per day?? $12 on top of the $30 per day resort fees?? Bologna!  Prepare to hike your way to your room. Not a good choice for people who are on a budget, don't like to waste time, and are too smart!  OR have a hard time getting around. Especially when you realize that the sigh of relief you experienced when you arrived back at your hotel was premature for the10-15 minutes of walking until you arrive at your room door.
minus^The place was old overall.  The water pressure from the shower was very low, was just dripping.  Temperature of the water from the shower was not stable, sometimes cold and sometimes hot. It is not worth staying.  With the price of MGM, I can stay in some more luxurious resorts.
plus^Great location . Great resort
minus^The rooms were dark and corridors leading to the rooms felt unsafe  The hotel is way too big taking you 30 minutes to get to a room
plus^The staff and the hotel itself. It has all you need for entertainment. I left my iPhone in the casino and they kept it at Lost & Found. They have a good security procedure.
minus^There was too many people for the EDC.
plus^It is hard to pick something I didn't like! Great location. Would highly recommend the MGM. Can't wait to come back and stay here next year
minus^n/a
plus^Staff was excellent,breakfast was excellent, but dinners was fair. I tho l better selection of food is on your room service menu.
minus^Dinners were fair. I thought the room service menu was better selection than what was on buffet.  The buffet was a little pricy for what your getting.  Just my opinion.
plus^Nothing
minus^Employees are rude not helpful at all. Way over priced. Shower was broke they had to come to my room for 45 min to fix.. Horrible I would never stay here again.
plus^Bed comfy, plenty of choice of restaurants
minus^The west wing rooms on ground floor where we stayed, the room itself was fine, just quite dark and dreary, window opened up on to the side of the street where the bins were, very loud when people returning to their rooms, felt a little bit like being on campus!
plus^The room was lovely and spacious, located close to the lifts too which made things super convenient.
minus^The walk to the car park from the hotel was quite long, and wasn't signposted from the lobby area.
plus^Very clean and and a lot of good restaurants
minus^That my reservations was under only my last name .. when on line when I booked I put the reservations under my whole name
plus^Location
minus^Lack of information about parking, and abut accommodation.  They are working very hard to charge as much as possible after the reservation. We have paid more than 45 USD parking, also a lot of food and beverage we don't used. Also they are very careful to don't have the opportunity to make any claim. First you need to pay ( I think the last bill was double that the reservation on booking.com ), after you agree to PAY and LEAVE , maybe you will have the chance to send comments by email s.o. Is not a matter of money, but the way how they are doing , you feel that you are spoiled. So AVOID MGM.
minus^There was a resort fee of 40 USD that was not reflected in the booking.com search result. This resulted in my final price being almost 50% higher than what I was expecting to pay.  This seems general Vegas practice so watch out!
plus^Staff friendly.
minus^Rooms way overpriced, small rooms, ate dinner across the bridge, construction blocked bridge.  Total bill was over $700.00  for two nights with no refrigerator.
plus^Nothing
minus^Buffet was over priced. We didn't know about a 400$ deposit. Then the only reembursed us 200$ back. Our first room was falling apart. Blood stain on the bedsheets.
plus^Location of casino is nice.
minus^The size of room was horrible.  No privacy in the bathroom area.  Too expensive.  This room is for one person only, not two.  View was horrible, facing a wall.  They should not even rent out these rooms, save it for storage only.  We should have been discounted for the inconvenience.
plus^Entertainment, facilities and restaurants are alot and very unique Best checkin and check out process and fast
minus^Room view, amenities almost empty and not been replaced and cleaned ie coffee glass, shampoo, No possible to hv room upgrade Room service enquires took 1H
plus^Good location with so much to do. Everyone very attentive. Overall very happy.
minus^I didn't like that there are a lot of hidden costs- for example I had to pay an extra £100 per night per room as a deposit- I know I will get it back, but it's just a bit of a worry that all of that money will come out of my bank for some reason.
plus^Location
minus^Tired corridors, dirty room, permanent smoke smell in the room, cockraches in the halls, less than clean sheets, worn out towels, felt worst than a prison cell. Never again
plus^Johnny rockets and ka
minus^We couldn't charge drinks to our room from the pool. We called 3x to get a movie fixed we rented it didn't work. We missed the pool dj because we couldn't leave and come back and we couldn't charge drinks to the room. When we checked in we were told we could.we paid a 500 deposit
plus^Atmosphere was great Good food
minus^Our shower leaked all over the floor frokna broken down seal, continuously had to put lots of towels down.  Low lighting in rooms Kids screaming down the hall at 5am and parents screaming at each other.
plus^Nothing
minus^Complained about the cleanliness of bathroom, hairs in shower. Was reluctantly moved to a second supposedly cleaned room which has stained bedlinen. Was given a third room, which was a free upgrade, but still not as good or cheap as rooms in tropocana or flamingo that we have previously stayed in. Revolting experience
plus^Great & comfortable stay. Got upgraded to a higher floor with a spacious room & view. The buffet is sumptuous but can be expensive. Casinos & live cirque shows are fantastic. Ask for the refurbished rooms.
minus^its too crowded hence the check in/checkout process can be a hassle. It takes around 20-30 mins.  The restaurants within the hotel are good but can be unnecessarily expensive so be careful.
plus^Location of hotel. Casinos. Laundry services and housekeeping staff. Awesome. Good job.
minus^CHECK IN. TOO MUCH TIME IT TOOK. THAT BAD. WE R ALREADY EXHAUSTED AFTER TRAVEL AND U GUYS ASK US TO WAIT IN A LONG QUE.
minus^walking in the hall to get to my room all I could breath was smell of weeds people smoking in the rooms, there was a sign near the elevator , no smoking level, that was a joke.
plus^The beds were amazing, the lazy river and pool cabana's were exceptional, and plenty of activities.
minus^Pre-check in service didn't work. We did the pre check in waiting for an email only to find out late that afternoon it wasn't processed. Ended up waiting for 45 minutes to check in after a full day of waiting - not happy that we missed out on some of our group activities that day. Bathroom isn't private enough. No view at all.
plus^I liked that I could go up to my room after a concert.  I liked that it was easy to take monorail.
minus^The Buffett was horrible at $68 for two people, I expected more. I had to pay $12 a day for parking.  There was a rule about being clothed until you got to the pool.  However, it was not enforced til the third Day I was there.  The room was ok but nothing to talk about.  Bed was super uncomfortable.  We paid about same amount to stay at the Wynn and it's 100 times better today to stay at the Wynn.
minus^Hotel was dirty, bedroom had beer bottles lids. I had to request to be moved to another room because my entire hall was smelling like Weed and had to argue with the staff that wasn't very helpful saying that they couldn't do anything about it. Hotel was dirty, supposedly it's a non smoking hotel, people smoked everywhere and I didnt see any no smoke signal around the property or security team enforcing the policy. Disgusting and I am not coming back at all! 
plus^Right on the strip
minus^The room they gave us was a deal price room we got online.  Which put us on a journey just to find it. Felt like cause it was a online deal room (that was $136) they have these rooms with no view, way away from the normal rooms, that just made you feel cheap. Room was smaller than a cruise ship room. And this place was extremely packed and fast paced. And they charged  $12 for parking,  even when we were staying there.
plus^The breakfast buffet had a great selection of food, and the monorail stops right outside. Although at the very beginning of the strip closest to the airport, it's not out of the way to where all the fun starts.
minus^We booked the MGM through Booking.com a year in advance for a 30th birthday trip. We turned up after being awake for nearly 21 hours to be told we didn't have a booking and they couldn't find our reservation. Not a great start to the celebrations, but after another hour they managed to find us a room even though we were told they were full. It wasn't a great room, 2nd floor with a view of a brick wall, but better than nothing! Upon check out 3 days later we were presented with a bill a lot higher than we booked through Booking.com. After a few phone calls the MGM staff did knock off all the resort fees in the end which was a nice touch after all the hassle we had.
plus^Comfortable, clean, great views
minus^Hotel is so large, getting anywhere takes forever. Wouldn't recommend for family with children or anyone who has waking difficulties. In fact, or anyone who likes to get to their room in under 25 minutes from the front door. 😂
plus^Lots of choice in restaurants and bars. The spa was great and the reserve pool was a nice,getaway.
minus^It's a huge property yet the walk around was welcome.
plus^Good size room, if you pay extra for it
minus^I just found it very commercial.  Charges for this that and everything that they could.  Please check your bill carefully before you leave to make sure it's accurate!
plus^Loved this hotel. We upgraded to a Stay Well Room. I can't compare the room to any others, because I didn't see them, but ours was very spacious, very comfortable bed, great bathroom and nice big window. The view wasn't great, but then I didn't ask for a room with a view, and we didn't spend masses of time there anyway. Room was quiet despite being in such a big hotel, and very clean, with no hint of cigarette smoke. Even the lobby, which was smoky, felt pretty good due to the high ceilings. I really hate cigarette smoke, and was expecting to be bothered by it, but wasn't at all. Location of the hotel was excellent, so close to everything. My favourite thing about the hotel was the swimming pool (busy, but lots of fun) and the spa. We got access to the spa with our room upgrade, and usually we were the only people in there. It was a lovely quiet respite from the madness of Vegas. I would absolutely stay here again - may consider a room in the signature suites, which seemed quite close to the pool.
minus^The view from our room was a bit average, but then we didn't ask for a room with a view so may be worth doing this. The price of food everywhere in the MGM, esp starubucks... but this is true of everywhere in Vegas,  made worse because of the terrible exchange rates! But wouldn't let any of that put me off....
plus^The flat screen behind registration
minus^You have to stay in a seperate part from the hotel. Looks old dirty. Long corridors like a dungeon feel. Horrible. I paid 214.00 for one day to stay in a place worse than the old circus circus hotel. Never again will i ever... Stay there
plus^Rooms enormous with king beds, no noise at night. Very clean. Like a city in itself, non stop gambling, eating and drinking as expected for las vegas
minus^Prices in the hotel were about 3 times what they were on street. Too large a complex for me, we kept getting lost! Would go for smaller hotel next time.
plus^The pool, bar and things to do just in the hotel. It's huge. And the buffet is amazing, try get a free one included with your room.
minus^The room looked outdated and it only had a couple of lamps in the main room. No main light. The wifi also cut out quite a bit during our stay.
plus^Nothing
minus^The room and the place was just very disorganized. It took us about 2hrs to check in. They weren't ready for that crowd. The room was to small. To expensive for the size of the room.I will never uae booking.com again.
plus^Overall, the location was great, staff and restaurants
minus^The rooms are not soudproof, I could hear everything happening in the room next to me. The guy next door was coughing all night which was really annoying. I was sleepless for 2 days because of him.
plus^There were several bars inside
minus^Long wait times for staff to answer phone, and the cleaning staff was rude. VERY RUDE Not a great view Room service took over an hour Crappy appliances & t I've stayed at holiday inn's that were nicer lol
plus^The location.
minus^Our first room had a NASTY shower - dirt caked on the floor of it, etc. We called the front desk, who said they'd send housekeeping up while we went to dinner. After dinner, we decided to speak to the front desk since it was our wedding anniversary, and we didn't want to stay in a room where we felt we needed shower shoes for the price we paid. They upgraded us after we showed them a picture of the shower. By upgrade, I mean they put us in a newly renovated room with 2 queen beds after mentioning it was our anniversary. While switching rooms, we noticed that housekeeping never even came to fix the first room's dirty shower. However, we were up all night with our door shaking whenever someone closed their door in the hallway (which you can imagine in Vegas, is at all hours of the night). Overall, not impressed with the service and quality there given the price we paid and expecting a four star hotel.
plus^Pros - Pool is great! This is why we chose the MGM Grand - Prime location on the strip. - Super friendly and knowledgeable staff.
minus^Cons - - Room REEKED of weed. Called down to the front desk to report and they sent up housekeeping. Their only solution was to spray disinfectant spray in the room which was a bit suffocating. Room continued to reek of weed for the duration of our stay. - The room we stayed in had no view. Because we were on the second floor, our room faced a wall, with about 6 feet of space in between. The view outside of our window was mostly trash that people had thrown out of their windows as well as some trash bags.
plus^Casino was good, pool was great, curiosity baggage holding was also a great plus.
minus^Room walls are extremely thin, could hear EVERYTHING happening from outside the room inside. Someone knocked on our door at 5 am yelling room service ( more than likely someone who had too much to drink) .
plus^The pool
minus^I was charged more than what I booked at bookings.com, the room was so far that most of my energy was drained only in travelling to and coming out of room. Hotel staff comes after 30 mins when required. Even in a suit room, they don't provide you with basic amenities like a microwave, a fridge, water boiler or coffee maker. Pathetic!
plus^Love Love Love the amazing swimming pool.
minus^The beginning rooms in the West Wing are scary, drab and right out of a horror movie.  Pay extra to stay in the towers.
plus^This place is HUGE! Stayed for a long weekend. Went to Wet Republic and had a blast. The pools are very nice. Went to Coco's across the street for really good eats, that were a bargain. Got upgraded to a nice room with a view of the airport and Tropicana. The layout of the hotel rooms can be very confusing.
minus^I miss the days where you could really get a good deal going to Vegas.
plus^Great room for a great price
minus^Needed hot water for instant noodles. You can get some if you order room service worth $30 OR pay $25 to rent a kettle for a day. Pretty fucking ridiculous.
plus^Pool.
minus^Old, messy, no facilities in the room (not even a washing liquid but plain soap), no coffee machine in the room, anything inside overpriced, and MOST IMPORTANTLY - do not book the deal complimentary buffet. It's a scam. We had two nights there and two complimentary buffet. We could use one only bc they refused to give us breakfast the second day because they argued that the complimentary buffet was valid for the check in day. Total BS given that if you check in the evening like most Europeans traveling there you cannot use it since it's a breakfast or lunch buffet. Staff anodyne. Ok it's vegas, but there're ways better hotels to go to.
plus^Since the hotel is a member of mlife group, we can park in the garage of anyother hotels of the group in the strip. This is quite convenient when we want to see the volcano show in front of the Mirage, which is 3 kilo away from MGM. But be sure to plan your route in case of traffic jam.
minus^The sound insulation of the room is not so good that I can always hear the sound such as  opening or closing doors of other rooms and people talking on the corridor. It is quite annoying especially on the day when the rooms are full.
plus^Good location, big hotel. Good atmosphere.
minus^2 out of 3 times we had cold water out of the shower. Tried calling front desk - no answer. Paying 40 dollars resort fee per night but still charging 10 dollars for a locker at the pool - not a great service.
plus^ZA......
minus^COLD shower... both night and morning.  Was promised one night free parking.  Was charged for it.  Booked Queen size, ended up having to pay extra $20 for King..... or accept two twin beds.....   Telephone worked 3 on scaled of 1 to 10.  WiFi was not up to standard...     Will never stay or recommend MGM property, anywhere.
minus^I was a little sticker shocked when I went to check in and they have a $400 deposit for the room. On top of what the room was costing me. I feel they need to make that statement bolder when booking.
plus^Confortable bed, nice room, perfectly clean and quiet
minus^Too mamy fees and taxes unexpressed at the moment of booking and paying for the parking on top of it was a robbery!
plus^The staffs were very nice and helpful. My favourite part was checkin. We got our room straight away.
minus^I would have loved at least coffee and tea facilities.There were no cups in the room. I wish there was more variety of food to choose from. And Vegas is a city that never sleeps at night, but the food places closed early.
plus^Rooms were lovely, clean and modern with a great shower area. The online/mobile check-in/check-out made things very simple and quick. It's in close proximity to the airport (uber ~$10) and has a walkway linking it to New York New York and on to Excalibur which is very convenient. There are a few pools to choose from with a decent amount of sun loungers​.  The hotel also hosts a number of shows. We didn't eat there much but there were plenty of options...food court, buffet and restaurants. Bus stop for Deuce (operating on the strip and down to Freemont costing $8 for 24hr ticket) is just down the road by New York New York.
minus^The staff weren't the friendliest upon check-in and didn't introduce us to any of the hotels amenities which left us slightly underwhelmed. The hotel was huge which is a plus on one hand however some amenities weren't signposted very well so you might not discover them for days. The room did not have a bath, fridge or tea/coffee making facilities. The WiFi and TV signal wasn't very reliable but did the job most of the time. Rooms could be more sound proof... earplugs are advisable it is Vegas after all. Frozen cocktails at the pool were pricey ($24 each!) but did have a lot of booze in them 😂
minus^I am doing a cross country trip on a motorcycle. They had a great place to park just for motorcycles.The parking is far way from the desk. The room was far way from the counter. So I had to carry my stuff a long way. The price on the app said $130, then there was a resort feeI don't know what that is but it turned out my room was about $200. I think they should just tell you the real price. Not really impressed with the whole Vegas thing. 
plus^Hotel was in a good location, close to deuce bus stop and monorail station in the hotel. Check in was fine and we didn't wait too long. Our hotel room was good not too far from the lobby, but it is quite a walk through the casino to the strip, which is not always pleasant because of the smoking allowed. The lifts to rooms were good and we didn't wait long at any time. Pools were good and you could usually get a bed but at some of the pools the music was far too loud.  Hotel served its purpose but I think a lot of improvements are needed, would not choose to stay here again as there are far nicer hotels more central on the strip.
minus^Smokey casino and compared to other hotels it looked like it was time for an update.  On our last day all the pools were closed as there was a convention taking place. We were given no warning at all. They left the lazy river open for all the hotel guests but obviously this could not accommodate all who wanted to use the pools.  Obviously they weren't interested in the holiday makers and it spoilt our last day. We were offered the pools at the signature ( a 10 minute walk through a walkway)  but these were only small rectangle pools, not exactly what we paid for. Also they do not provide umbrellas around the pools unless you pay out for the large beds.  No kettle or fridge in room which should be provided as standard.
plus^The pool had a great lazy river and the hotel was conveniently located next to the Coke store and the M&M store.
minus^Walking down the hall to our room, we commented on how dark and uninviting it appeared.  The carpet had seen better days and there was a lot of paint peeling around the door frames. Immediately upon checking into our room, a cabinet door fell off.  That wasn't a good sign. The room was dimly lit and the bathroom had very little privacy (glass doors around the toilet).  In all fairness, we stayed in the West Wing, which is the oldest part of the hotel.  It is in need of refurbishment and updating.  The carpet was dirty and sticky and the shower door leaked onto the bathroom floor.  There are no fridges in the rooms, which I'm sure is a calculated effort to have guests buy over-priced beverages in the casino ($4.75 for a bottle of water).  The closest exit to the strip from our room was a door that opened onto an alley where the dumpsters are stored.  You are met with the aroma of garbage and sewage.   While the hotel had a great pool and lazy river, be prepared for sticker shock when you learn that it is $25 to rent a tube to float down the lazy river. During our stay a group of frat boys that had been drinking too much began pouring beers over the heads of toddlers while they played in the wading pool.  The lifeguard informed us that there was nothing he could do about it. The casino needs to better enforce the dress code.  We had children with us, and it was very uncomfortable to walk through the casino with them between the pool and our room.  We saw quite a few young ladies wearing nothing more than a thong bikini with no cover-up inside the casino. To their credit, towards the end of our stay we did see hotel staff passing out plain white T-shirts to people who did not have swim cover ups on.     All-in-all, I expected much more from the MGM Grand.  I was excited for our stay, and left with no desire to return.
minus^Price/value was bad ... booking did not apply the 50% discount. for $250 you'd expect at least some view. I've stayed here before for much less in much better conditions. Not cool MGM.
plus^Lazy river was awesome. A few games downstairs.
minus^Room smelled vaguely of feces. Clearly a room for commoners, and not one of their better suites. The shower leaked badly onto the bathroom floor. Felt more like a cell than a room.
plus^The location is great on the strip. 
minus^The construction closed easy access to walk way. The bed was the worst I've ever slept in. Pillows were hard and flat. Wi-Fi didn't work and felt like we were in dungeon with room so dark and cell phone wouldn't work. The parking garage was behind our headboard that people could see into room. 
plus^Classic 'Las Vegas establishment' with all the high vibes. We stayed in one of the west wing rooms and it was great (although no view but we didnt need it). Comfy beds & good amenities. We really liked the Grand Buffet and the Sports Bar. Staff was very friendly and helpful from check-in through restaurants till bell boy service. Easy self-parking. All enertainment on site.  In sum, value for money.
minus^The smoke downstairs was overwhelming.  No fridge or mini bar in the room. TV didn't work but it was fixed within an hour after letting the staff know about it.
minus^I didn't like that you had to pay for parking (it should be free ) if your staying there ....And they charge $50 to use the mini fridge in your room ....And they charge for the simple snacks that were in the room
plus^It's is pretty close to everything on the strip. The whirl pool was really good, gym was great would recommend staying in the Staywell grand rooms if you stay.
minus^We couldn't use the fridge, when trying to use the fridge all items have a sensor on them so if you move something out they will know, they will charge you for an extra fridge. Room does not get cleaned unless you ask which I think is wrong considering for pay per night this service should be done daily. The room smelt like an ashtray.
plus^We got very good help and response when we were disappointed at the first room we got. The second room was newly renovated and very nice. Very big and cool pool area.
minus^We got a very bad room to start with, old and was in need of renovation. It wasn't cleaned properly either. We complained and got a room in the newly renovated section of the hotel which was way better!
plus^close to airport,hard to locate enterance,not adequate signs for enterance.hotel is well built with all the necessities,booking is well organized and friendly.
minus^car parking location , long distance  walking to the main building
plus^Loved the room and the facilities at the hotel! All stafff were helpful and friendly. Great location and the rooms are very spacious and comfortable. They are cleaned too. High standard everyday and the hotel has the best buffet in town.
minus^When we went to check out one of the staff members didn't really know what they were doing when we questioned some of our bill so she had to keep going and asking and it took about 40 mins to get sorted. Maybe training the staff a little better before putting them on front desk? But that was the only bad experience of the whole 5 days
plus^The property is very conveniently located close to the Mandalay Bay were the conference was and is pretty easy to navigate through the hotel.
minus^Even though the hotel was able to get me into my room early I was not happy at all where it was located.  It was on the 3rd floor which I couldn't find so I asked a security guard how to get to the 3rd floor.  It required me to go to the 4th floor then walk down a very long hallway to take an elevator down to the 3rd floor where I had to walk another very long hallway.  Being a woman traveling by myself I would have liked to have a room closer to an elevator.   Since I was only staying for 2 nights and I had unpacked my luggage as soon as I got into my room I didn't ask for another room.   If it happens again I will ask to be moved to another room.
plus^Staff is excellent. Location is perfect. Lots of amenities on site. Never have to leave the property! And there's a lazy river.
minus^We had the west wing king. It's like a dungeon on the ground floor. A maintenance person walked by our window.
plus^The salmon at Pub 1842 Was so good. Lazy river pool is awesome, my main reason to stay at MGM
minus^Shower door didn't close all the way. Water got all over the floor. Closet light wouldn't turn off. no lock on toilet door.
plus^Nothing
minus^I'm never staying in MGM again .. stayed there for 3 days only one day my room was cleaned, repeated request for housekeeping was neglected and we ran out of towel and room was dirty.. who would like to come back to unmade bed in the hotel room .. why spend so much money on 5 star hotel when service is so poor, when we called front desk to complain they blamed us for putting do not disturb sign on the door which was not there in our room in the first place.. very bad experience.. customer service was really bad.only saving grace was the pool n everything close by..
minus^I could not believe the prices you charge. $25 a night for a refrigerator? $20 a night for parking? $30 for a walk through Serve Yourself meal? Absolutely absurd. Probably won't be coming back. It's too bad too because we used to stay there a lot. Sorry we just can't afford you
plus^The A/C was on point. The comforter and pillows were magical. The room included a safe and the lazy river is pretty cool.
minus^Upon finding our room (8th floor room 502) the door had a kick mark as though Las Vegas SWAT had just booted the door down. The inside door guard latching lock was actually broken off; confirming that someone had indeed probably broken into the room prior to our arrival.  Then upon entering the room the drawers were opened. I'm not sure who ransacked our room but it was very peculiar sight to behold. The bed was made and the amenities were fully stocked so no complaints there. However we did find pretzels all over one side of the bed... neither my wife or myself had pretzels...  The bathroom glass was stained with a mysterious white crust and the floor tiles had grim. The bathroom glass is a little less private than I would have liked since there were no doors deprecating the bed or bath areas and you could hear I pin drop, as well as other things. The mirror in the bath has a inlet screen with a camera facing outward into the bathroom but no option to turn it on... I have no idea if this was a poor quality spy cam or the remenant of a tv option in the bathroom they used to offer but it's creepy as hell. Oh and the mirror is on a hinge that just leads into the buildings skeleton as though someone had dug out the wall to escape Alcatraz.  Be sure to close the room door because it doesn't close by itself. My wife and I were closing room doors left and right of people who did not close them properly.  Outside the casino doors on the strip the MGM needs to have security shoo away the riff raff. I was constantly asked if I wanted to buy party favors, or if I was a racist because I didn't want to buy the loser's mix tape he made.
minus^Room was not cleaned bath room was disgusting, a few empty cigarette packs were there ( In  A NO SMOKING ROOM) ,so I requested to change it ; to move my belonging  to new room , I walk all the long hall way three times back and fort to the Hotel front desk ,as the keys did not work; finally a security lady helped me ( she was shocked when I show her the room) . It took 45 minutes of my times and I  was late for my meeting. I used MGM before and recommended to my friends  , but it was the last one. Sorry MGM
plus^Location was perfect.
minus^Resort certainly did not meet our expectations. Room standards were poor, dated and hygiene needed improvement. Hotel needs major updating.
plus^Old school style but room dirty and on speaking with team on check out they failed to acknowledge our point of view.
minus^Cleanliness and noise of room. Poor service levels in response to disappointment.
plus^Location
minus^Not enough chairs at the pool, if you go at 11 am it is impossible to find a chair. The river side was closed however a lot of chairs were piled up there, but no one from the staff bothered doing anything about it when we complaint.
plus^The casino and restaurants are very nice, great location on the strip.
minus^Alcohol was overpriced and room was not very nice. Lack of privacy because the room lacked sound barrier so you could hear in other people's rooms and anyone's conversation walking by our room. The location of the room seemed to scream cheap rooms this way because the carpet and wallpaper in the hallway changes into a different and ugly/dirty looking style. The bathroom/toilet is right next to the door to the room...which is awkward. If you pay more to get a nicer room I'm sure the stay is excellent, but looking for a bargain (which is still expensive) gets you a less desirable room for sure. The Buffett was upsetting as well...we only ate breakfast there, but it is extremely overpriced for old, tasteless, and poorly cooked food.
plus^I loved the decor of the hotel in its entirety, staff was very nice and friendly. My favorite was the pool area. The water temperature was perfect. We ate dinner at Wolfgang Puck's Bar and Grill. We were seated right away and our food was promptly delivered. I attended the Chris Brown concert in the Garden Arena, which was amazing! Overall, I has an excellent experience and would love to stay here again!
minus^The ONLY thing that kind of rubbed me the wrong way was the reception staff at the spa. They did not have the best customer service and detoured my friend and I not to use the services.
plus^The safety box is very nice.
minus^We upgraded our room, however, there is no coffee machine in the room. We have to pay $30 dollars extra to rent a coffee machine or hot water boiler.  :-(
plus^Housekeeping staff were very polite and friendly
minus^I emailed ahead of my visit to say I was travelling for a special celebration, it was my partners birthday the day I arrived and I had booked to take him to Vegas as a surprise and I was told the concierge would make him feel special and they would add a note to my Booking. I didn't expect gifts or upgrades but they didn't even say Happy Birthday when we checked in which was thoroughly disappointing.
plus^Great central location with all you can ask for in terms of entertainment, food & everything in between. Rooms are a good size & really comfortable.
minus^The hotel is really huge, it can take a while to get around & easy to lose your room if you're not paying attention. If you're not into big crowds & noise - this place is probably not for you.
plus^All the waitresses and waiters were really nice.
minus^No Coffee or Micro-wave in the room and we were told as a RESORT it is not offered in the rooms. Also stayed 3 nights and had to ASK for clean towels the women when we asked for clean towels was really nice and said  Your not on our list to clean but I will give you towels really we are there for 3 nights and they expect us to use same towel for 3 days???  It was really nice and pretty and I can most definitely say I would not go again. We upgraded our room as we were told we could look out over the pools. Not so much unless we had a pair of binoculars . Over all I was not pleased for my first time of being there not best trip that's foresure!!!! Would not recommend .
plus^The buffet was excellent and the atmosphere of the MGM is great! The real Vegas!
minus^There weren't any coffee making facilities in the room and the beds were not too comfortable.
plus^I'm still dreaming about the breakfast buffet. So amazing
minus^I'm pretty sure the back of my car was hit in the parking garage because it started to fly off on our way home out of nowhere
plus^Location of hotel
minus^Bed sheets weren't changed.  Food crumbs were left in the bed. Bad was so dirty I ended up leaving the room earlier then scheduled
minus^They offered us an upgrade in a floor they said had just been remodeled. That room turned out to be so late in getting cleaned we weren't able to check in the room until 7.30pm (check in time was supposed to be 3pm) they offered us a discount on food which for me just wasn't enough. To add to that they had us on a floor which they said had just been remodeled. In the bathroom laminate and vinyl was lifting and there were holes in the walls.  The steam room was falling apart so we weren't able to use that either.  Very poor customer service and I've been telling everyone that asked me about my stay not to book into the MGM. 
plus^Central location, massive casino and selection of restaurants.
minus^Our room was right by the lift, some did hear some noise. Maybe a sign by the lifts for people to respect sleeping guests.
minus^The wait at the front desk to check in is terrible.,there were 3-4 clerks just standing around chatting or fiddling with their computers while we waited and waited and waited some more. My room was completely at the end of a very very long hall on the west wing.
minus^I noticed while I was there on Arbonne conference the room xost s were so high and they dropped before and after, it was hard because I was on a budget
plus^Pool was really great and location.
minus^For a 4-5 star property we had a cold shower every day and the taps kept falling off... The quality of the bathroom was really bad.
plus^Room was spacious and clean.
minus^-too big.  If you forget something in your room just do without because it will take you forever to go back and get it. -lazy river was closed when we were there so the pool was very crowded and it was difficult to find a chair -when we checked out, there was a $12 minibar charge on our bill.  When I complained the staff insisted I must have used the minibar or 'looked at it.'  I did not and, after some discussion, the charge was removed from my bill.
plus^David Copperfield show arena is located in this hotel - that's very comfortable if you plan to see this show - you don't need to go somewhere, lose time etc. and the show is worth one's time!
minus^the hugeness of the hotel - you just go and go and go just to find the pool or the breakfast place or anything... little time is left then to use all the opportunities, when you have to spend so much time to find them:)
plus^Nothing to like,  tipical Vegas hotel, desperate to screw you out of as must money as they can from all areas, will not be returning to the MGM. As for booking . com just booked my last trip with them :(
minus^Very confused about the the costing formate with room, the room was very small and the toilet and washing areas within the room were very badly designed offered no privercy , staff were miserable most of the time
plus^Whiskey Down had incredible cocktails. Mobile check in was very easy to use and super convenient!
minus^The whole reason I stayed at MGM was the lazy river and it was closed. I was not told it was closed before my stay which was very frustrating. The dealers were also terrible. They were not fun or engaging. I wouldn't gamble much at this hotel in the future. Winning is nice but out of my control, but the dealers all seemed to be having the worst day of their lives.
plus^I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. The hotel is huge with basic Las Vegas style rooms. My stay was comfortable (except the first night, see above) and I enjoyed a good view of the Strip the 2nd and 3rd night after I moved rooms.  All staff I encountered were always extremely helpful and friendly which was appreciated and made my stay more comfortable. The hamburger in the TAP restaurant was delicious! There is a lot of good hotel competition in Las Vegas and I would therefore never stay in this hotel again nor recommend it for reasons explained above.
minus^My first night I had a room with an adjoining room. Although the doors were closed and locked between the rooms I could hear my neighbours talking until 3am and therefore had to sleep with earplugs. There was a small air draft coming though the adjoining doors and when they would go to the bathroom I could smell it in my room!  This is the first time I have ever had this experience in a hotel.   Reception was really helpful when I called them to explain this and they moved me to another room but charged me a $20 upgrade fee plus related taxes because they did not have any more rooms available in my category!  There are several swimming pools outside and the area was packed with a lot of empty beer cans blowing around the deck pool. In the morning of my 2nd night, there was a young man passed out with a beer bottle at his feet sleeping in his shorts on one of the chairs next to the elevators (see photo).  I watched several hotel staff pass by and look at him and then continue on with whatever they were doing. I returned to the room some time later and he was still there. Given the above, I would never recommend this hotel nor chose to stay at the MGM Grand again.
plus^The room we stayed in was fantastic. A spa suite. Very spacious and comfortable.
minus^The bloody awful check in line up! What a circus!! The smoking. No coffee facilities! Can't use the the fridge unless you pay $25 what a joke!! And don't believe for a moment you are going to get to relax by the pool... with 1000s of others!! River pool wasn't open. Bars were disappointing! And get ready to cart your bags from the car park ridiculous! Consequently we spent all our time at other casinos- lucky the room was lovely.
plus^Spacious room. Surprisingly quiet. Good food outlets. Grand pool excellent
minus^Far too busy on Saturday night (fight night) made for a less than pleasant experience due to boorish behaviour. No shower gel in rooms
plus^I loved that there was no need to leave.   So many things to do and see right in one place.   We caught a show and leaving that and getting to our room was the only way to go!
minus^Could use more pillows and we did alot of walking just to get to and from our room.
plus^MGM is convenient to NY NY, Excalibur and the Strip, also loved all the amenities, friendly staff and cleanliness! I'm already planning my next trip.
minus^Not one complaint.
plus^Employees were warm and friendly
minus^My wait for the room once we checked in was about 6 hours.  I understood that I checked in early but the time we waited after a normal check-in was unreasonable.  However, an employee recognized our long wait and was proactive and waived the resort fees for two days.
plus^The wifi was terrible.  The room wasn't all the way clean when we checked in, and had to call to request housekeeping to come on the second day late in the evening.  The Day Spa was absolutely phenomenal and the pool area was great.  Overall would stay again, simply for the spa and pool.  The front desk staff was so sweet and helpful.
minus^The bell hop was rude.
plus^Great place to stay the room was a good size, so many restaurants to pick from in MGM it's self overall great facilities & near Las Vegas strip.
minus^There is a lot of hidden charges in your bill like: • resort fee $ 30-35 per night  • resort fee tax  • Room fee • Room tax fee  Don't get a upgrade because they charge you the fee and also tax on it !!! Watch out
plus^I only liked the friendly staff.
minus^I was very disappointed with my stay. Last time I stayed at tge ceasers palace and it was wonderful. This time I wanted to try MGM and was my worst experience. I reserved like 3 months prior to my stay and got send to a North wing room that looked and felt isolated from the whole hotel.i had a view of an ally or wall. And felt I overplayed for my stay. Will never return again.
plus^Location 
minus^Small room not suitable for 4 people, smelt of cigarettes and marijuana, hot water would not run, would have to wait some 20-30 mins of cold water running first, AC wasn't working, room hadn't been cleaned on one of the days, complained too many times. Finally moved to another room, but all took too long caused a downer to the holiday. 
plus^It's the MGM Grand - what more do you need to know?!
minus^You have to pay extra for everything - quite expensive, but then that is expected from such a top level hotel.
plus^Ambiance, location, options of food, casino experience
minus^It was first time in LV and MGM Grand. I had booked a west wing room paying whatever it cost. The check in staff said that they are giving south wing room, since I did not know what was in  West wing or south wing took it. Later found south Wing was boring backdoor warehouse view. The whole experience of LV strip was in West Wing. Felt cheated. 
plus^The room equipment/amenities were really high standard. The hotel is close to the airport with a shuttle service. It is just the beginning of the strip. If you prefer you do not need to move from it as you find everything in there.
minus^the upcharge on the quoted price is more than 20%! The room was too big for one person. The stairs look impressive yet at the end you have to walk them up with luggage;-).
plus^Staff is super friendly and helpful, the hotel is clean and has a little bit of everything for everyone :)
minus^The bathroom was big and clean, too bad there's no detachable shower head, and no possibility to take a bath. There is a bathtub, there's no stopper. And we had no warm water in the sink. Other than that it was awesome :)
plus^The bed was excellent
minus^Long lines everywhere in the morning to have breakfast. This is not convenient when you are a business traveler. Long walks to get anywhere.
plus^We liked the room they upgraded us to.
minus^The suite we booked was ridiculous, it was small and old and cramped and so far from everything the walk was too much. We got them to upgrade because I was there for my birthday and I literally cried when I saw that room. It should have been torn down, it was part of an old hotel. My friends paid the same price for a beautiful king suite in the actual MGM Grand. Stay away from that west wing at ALL COST. Even the staff is enbrassed of it.
plus^Staff extremely efficient and helpful. Location excellent. Choice of eateries good.
minus^Dirty washers hanging on shower curtain rail. Close to cleaners room making it a little noisy.
plus^Easy to park coffee easily available
minus^Charging whole stay and a $300 dollar deposit that is not returned to credit card for 10 days. Three days $900 regular room. I called ahead and checked in before I left the house and that I would arrive around 11:00 pm and when I arrived at 10:30 they did not have my King bed that I had payed for they gave me 2 Queen beds. Bad service and loyalty by MGM reminds me of the overbooking fiasco on United Airlines. Bathrooms are cheap tubs with tile instead of the Quality you find at the Belagio or Mandalay Bay.
plus^Location and fact that monorail was right there
minus^I did not like the bathroom layout.  No privacy in toilet area and no where to get dressed after existing shower.  It was ok for me because I was with my spouse but I imagine it would be awkward w a friend or new partner
plus^Casino area was nice. Wolfgang puk restaurant was very good. Very comfortable bed.
minus^The hallway to our room was very dark and dingy. Glass partition bathroom shower combo in the entry of rooom is awkward and allows for everything to be heard In the whole room.
plus^Easy check out
minus^Dark,depressing room,smelly,west wing should not have any stars,air conditioning in the room loud,inconvenient placed by bed,bad sound isolated room.Staff in corridors no hospitable ,no greeting .Never back to MGM,for this price much better 3 stars hotels around
plus^The facilities were great - the pool, the casino, the range of restaurants and bars 👍🏼 The room was perfect too, lots of room, comfy beds and an amazing view from the 28th floor :)
minus^They made things difficult during check in and out because we had booked through booking.com rather than with the hotel itself
minus^We attended an Arbonne conference - the queues were ridiculous. Access to the arena was ONE door - hate to think what would have happened during a fire!
plus^The hotel is more like a resort - several pools (including a lazy river), lots of beds by the pool and great music. It has a young feel so expect dancy tunes whilst you're sunbathing! The hotel has lots of restaurants, bars and shops but because it's Vegas it's all overpriced - expect to pay $3.50 for a banana! Hotel is opposite to New York New York and not far from Paris which is quite central to the strip. You can also ride the monorail from MGM to several spots on the strip but it's not free. Our only complaint was the casino stunk of smoke, probably one of the worst on the strip.
minus^The smell of smoke in the main casino area
plus^The front lobby seems very open and spacious, less smoke than in some other hotels, check in was very easy via mobile device. The room was nice modern and clean. Lots of dining options. Buffet breakfast was lovely.
minus^Pillows were not to my liking, not very soft. We didn't find a coffee maker in the room which was a bit odd. Pool facilities were so crowded we didn't even go there.
plus^There's some good entertainment, Topgolf is pretty cool. Comedy show was good, if you're easily offended or politically correct, don't go. Brad Garrett is extremely vulgar and offside but he is funny, the headliners were really good.
minus^I don't mind paying more in a resort town but getting ripped off just isn't enjoyable. I bought a piece of pizza and ranch dressing from the food court, 9.20 US$. It wasn't even that good. Went to a comedy show, had a single shot highball and small bottle of water, 22.50 US$(25.00 US$ with tip). REALLY???Total ripoff. Hotel casino was a SMOKEFEST, it's 2017, sorry, I care about my lungs. I rented a room with a king bed, after waiting in line at check-in for 15 min, I was informed that they didn't have any king beds left, they upgraded me to the Grand Tower with 2 twin beds. Beds were comfy, carpet was stained and remote for TV, didn't work. I've had much nicer stays in Vegas. Biggest ripoff is the resort fees that they charge upon check-in. If they're going to do that, guests should get a small discount when buying things in the resort. Give them 5-10%off things charged to their room. Give them a little sense of value. I honestly felt like an idiot paying such high prices for subpar items.
plus^Had originally booked 2 nights but stayed a third as it was our first time in Las Vegas and absolutely loved every minute of it. Fab hotel to stay in. Great location. Great buzz all the time and found everyone so friendly. Get bus outside the door and travel all day for $8. Stayed 3 nights and still didn't get to see all we wanted to see and do. An excuse to go back again!!!! Things are expensive but it's Vegas. Make sure to go to Freemont Street to the old strip and the Golden Nugget. Great cocktails there and reasonable. $4 & $6 each and fab.
minus^There wasn't anything we didn't like.
plus^The Grand was so big we found it difficult to find things e,g the pool.
minus^Not enough guidance to locate things, food in most restaurants and bars stopped too early . For such a night place food service should go much longer.
minus^I booked 6 nights on booking.com, but when i arrived after 15 hour flight, i only had 3 nights booked, mgm says that booking.com made the misstake, i got the wrong room and i change to ceasar palace after 3 nights. Was not happy.
plus^The room with the view was amazing - we had a great time at the pool and hakkasan night club. The buffet was awesome for dinner. Staff and check in was very easy and convenient
minus^Not enough chairs at the pool.
minus^Lovely hotel and very big  Had everything u needed and room was nice  However Considering they charge a lot for resort fees we didnt get wifi much as it kept cutting off, and there wasnt much space around the pool area. Staff were amazing Prices are extortionate for food and drink, even breakfast was around 20$
plus^Nothing
minus^Check in is 1 hour wait after long flight , less staff to cover such huge hotel. Check out is 30 mins wait.( I could not do the express check out as they wrongly charge me for the bills) They charge everything , kettle for making a coffee is $32 during stay, Charge me $9 for a can of coke which I didn't use, I have to wait long queen when checkout to explain them then they eventually wave the fee.
plus^The bed and shower rocked
minus^The customer service was awful they only cleaned our room once had to call for clean towels everyday our TV broke took maintenance forever and it was way to expensive
plus^Loved pools, music, hotel room,
minus^Last couple of days....Arbone arrived at hotel , thousands arrived in hotel.got so busy waited 45 mins for bar drink, no sunbeds waited ages for lift,I appeciate your a business... but the sheer volume of people spoilt our experience
plus^The bed was comfortable and the room was clean.
minus^There where no instructions from the hotel prior to arrival on where to unload luggage or where to park. Our room was too far from the car park and we had to drag our luggage through the casino. Everything revolves around the casino.
plus^The rooms looked like the pictures in the internet. It was a great stay. You will find everything you need (e.g. restaurants) within the hotel itself. the personal was great and very helpful. I would stay again there.
minus^I wouldn't recommend the North tower as the entrance and the building looked a little bit unattended. We couldn't open the window as the smell of the restaurant came in. They gave us another room in the Grand Tower, when we asked for it.
plus^The view of our room was unbeatable. The bathroom was gorgeous with a jetted tub and nice shower. The bed was very nice and comfortable. The room was by far the best I've ever stayed in. I would highly recommend it!
minus^I didn't like that we stayed for only one night.
plus^the pool party is the best ive ever been at, top golf is great for relaxing ,hitting a few balls and sipping on pints and the casino great crack with loads of free booze
minus^the cost of drinks in the night club, the parking fee, the hidden costs on arrival the were not made clear enough on booking such as the tax, the resort fee and the 3/400 per room that is held on your card and not returned for 3/4 days after check out
plus^The room was spacious, clean and very comfortable
minus^I didn't like that the parking valet ticket indicates, that as a room guest, we can call in to have our vehicle ready and when I called valet, the lady that answered said, for security purposes, we need you to come down and show us your ticket in order to get your vehicle. So my question is, why does the ticket indicate you can call in advance to have your vehicle ready for them to tell you, you can't ? I planned my trip and time with specific information your hotel provides. Your hotel is amazing, but really had a poor experience with that. Mind you, it's Vegas and there's tons of people !
plus^The bed was comfortable and the suite was very nice except for the view. It was facing the back of the hotel.
minus^The foul smell in the room when I first checked in.
plus^I like that the housekeeping were very accomodating and helpful.
minus^I don't like the fact that I have to pay $8 usd for just a band aid because the hotel does not provide first aid kits for their guests. And I noticed that most of the staff (especially the front desk) lack the knowledge of their own hotel and lack communication to each other because I got two or three different answers (with just one question) from different staff members.
plus^Location and ease getting to / from airport.  Steak restaurant was amazing
minus^Check in was the worst I've experienced, over priced small room, casino was like sitting in a chimney due to cigarette smoke,
plus^The room was perfect and confortable. The hotel facilities are amazing, the fast food court is perfect if you wanna save money in meals.
minus^The poor wifi connection.
plus^MGM Grand is an awesome hotel. Very large (can result in a long walk towards your hotel room). Overall great experience.
minus^We got a free upgrade (honeymoon). This was awesome. However, the room we got was a non-smoking room as requested, but someone obviously had been smoking in the room. The smell was terrible!
minus^Hotel is outdated and hotel still has to refund me deposits I paid for all rooms. also they have charged two different credit cards for one room when they said they would refund but they still have not.
plus^The pool was amazing. Tip: buy tubes from CVS for 4.99 to avoid paying 18.50 at the pool. Restaurant options are vast and cater to every craving. Monorail stop right at the hotel to take you to other locations.
minus^Rooms offer no noise protection. Bathrooms are glass, so no privacy, everyone can hear you using it. The hotel room was dated and old. The shower had strange blue goo on the floor. It was a long walk from locations within the hotel. 
plus^That I was on the Strip
minus^They charge me $200 dollars deposit and they only refund me $164 they said we open something from the fridge... but we never did.
plus^Honestly, there was a very very kind gentleman on Thursday morning who provided the best customer care I've ever experienced. I didn't get his name, he was at the information/key desk. I could tell that he loves his job, appreciates his guests, and very much loves the company he works for. Well done MGM & thank you!
minus^The parkade people...
minus^The fact that they clean out the grease traps at midnight (i.e. when most of Vegas is wide awake) which completely stank the place out. I thought we were being gassed / about to die, it was horrendous! Also that you have to pay $35 for a fridge... hmmmm.
plus^Very easy access to the areas but most of all my trip would have been awful without your in house scooters and you bought decent ones I was able to go everywhere without worrying about needing a charge - have you ever pushed a dead one NOT FUN
minus^The time it takes to check in - it was our 50th so we brought kids, grandkids, significant others(9) I called ahead to request all on the same floor and was advised Not to pre check in as we would have more success getting the same floor I wish I had as it took forever and we did not all get on the same floor anyway. They did try hard though. Perhaps it is difficult to get five grand kings on the same floor
minus^the room was quite small for paying nearly $300 for one night (with advance reservation) to far from elevator to room  and pool was I long walk as well
plus^Right off the strip. Huge hotel! Nice shows.
minus^Our room was at the end of the hallway upon exiting the elevator. Hallway started at 404 and we were at 552! Unreasonably far!😩
plus^The location and the activities
minus^The room was not good at all and we had to pay to upgrade.  It was in the older part of the hotel and felt like a closet without a window.   Once we moved to a normal room it was good.
plus^Bed was comfortable.
minus^Photos of the room were different to what I received. No couch Like described in booking details. I booked 3 rooms so I could clearly see the difference with mine. Customer service is horrible and very slack. Staff are very unorganised. No one has any idea what is going on and just pass you on to the next person. Television had no service most of the time of my stay. Room cleaning showed up 2 days into my trip after 2 calls and excuse of must of had do not disturb sign on. Would then tip room cleaners approx $20 just so they would come the next day. Cleaning was just making bed. Bell boy, luggage staff were the most useful and helpful in the resort. Last time in Vegas I stayed at the Cosmo and was blown away with how amazing service, room and location  was. I will never stay at MGM grand again.
plus^Fantastic location and casino - you will not be disappointed. Fitness centre was also superb !  Tip- don't buy water in the hotel - it's $6 a bottle and the little shop on the strip sells 2 bottles for $1 !!!!
minus^Smoking in casino !
plus^Location was brilliant, hotel itself was fantastic. Staff in casino tables were really nice and explained everything well.
minus^The staff were unfriendly at times in reception . Flights got cancelled so we had stay for an extra few of days. Price was pretty much the same for 3 day's as it was for the original 5 days and they were very unsympathetic and not very helpful as well as been very slow to process anything. Just to clarify only staff at reception as the staff at the casino tables were really lovely.
plus^Nice hotel, nice facilities
minus^Staff aren't accommodating at all. We were overcharged a lot along the way which as a Platinum M Life member I'm incredibly disappointed about. It has always been our go to Vegas hotel but we might have to reconsider in the future I think.
plus^The hotel had a great vibe and as I walked through the strip I felt even more sure that we had made the right hotel choice! The other hotels were lovely however The MGM stood out to us!
minus^The wifi signal let us down at times but that's about it.
plus^The bed was very comfortable.  The location is convenient.
minus^The walk through the casino is incredibly  smokey. This permeates the whole main floor and is irritating.  I resent being charged to put my own juice bottle in the room fridge.  The water pressure in the shower is almost non - existent.
plus^Staff is very helpful. Location is great.
minus^Bad smell of smoking on lobby/casino floor. There should be toothpaste & toothbrush provided in room.
plus^Good location
minus^Shockingly rude disrespectful and abusive security personnel at the pool! We fell asleep in the afternoon sun when I was woken up by someone kicking my deck chair hard and shouting abuse (Derrik). This was borderline assault! I cant believe a hotel of such standards can employ such people.
minus^Was in a non smoking room on a non smoking floor (9) and several times throughout the night we had smoke pumped into the room via the air conditioning system. I can assume the earlier comments about this are now true and accurate. I believe the main exhaust for all the smoking areas comes out near the intake for the rooms. Unacceptable.
plus^Mobile check in. The staff. Dining. Lots of options for things to do.
minus^The barhroom. How long of a walk to find your room. Getting to the entrance to the hotel.
plus^It was on the strip with easy access to many of the places I wanted to be.
minus^Poorly designed out dated rooms that were not very well maintained. Light switch in room had no faceplate.
plus^Comfortable bed, good location, lots of entertainment
minus^No kettle or ability to make hot drinks in room. Only coffee available was $6 from Starbucks Cold shower Strange smell in room at times coming from th vent!  Maid entered room Without knocking some mornings as early as 9am
minus^Did not like the room at alk, needs remodeling.  Hallway was very dirty, cinder block looking wallpaper.  Hallway smelled.  Bathroom counter extremely small.  Bath towels stored in the enclosed toilet area.  Time for a grand remodel.  Price should be greatly reduced.  Hotel also caters to large spring break crowd.  Perfect reason to never return during this time of year, if ever.
plus^I really liked the rooms, the size was really good. The bathrooms was also nice. The staff was super friendly.
minus^The elevators took forever, and when a elevator finally got there it was packed with people. The food at the hotel was quite overpriced. Lack of healthy food that wasn't too pricy.
minus^Initial room booked was in old section of the hotel.  Terrible!!  Had to pay a lot extra to upgrade to a newer section of the hotel.   Seems ridiculous.
plus^Nothing
minus^The bathroom, the room was so dark even with the couple of lights on.  The expensive restaurants.  Housekeeping never replenished the shampoo or soap.
plus^Customer service was perfect i loved the view of from the room.down fall was lost a lot of money machines did not pay at all breakfast was yummy and great shows and performances
minus^Machines did not pay lost over 1000 dollars
plus^The restaurant accessibility was nice.
minus^The rooms are in an unimpressive condition that are not worth the price of staying in them. There was bad water damage on the ceiling of the shower that looked near collapse. The very heavy glass door to the restroom was off of its hinges and it made opening the door a scary situation every time.
plus^New way of checking in, using kiosks. Large casino with many slot machines to choose from.
minus^Extra fees, (resort fee, parking, taxes). Huge price markup on basic necessities, (gift shop mostly). Absolutely NO payouts, (or even a little back), on ALL machines played.
plus^The hotel is so big you can spend your entire vacation inside and not need anything.  1) Breakfast buffet was fabulous. Wow. It has anything/everything you can think of.  2) Pools are big  3) Casino is massive  4) Hakassan (one of the biggest/best clubs) is inside the hotel itself, which is very convenient  5) Plenty of Activities  6) Lots of food options (Johnny rockets, pizza,..) and even your own Starbucks within
minus^1) The hotel is on the strip, however it is not in the hustle/bustle of it: You need a 5 minute walk to get to the main part.  2) Im not sure how this compares to the other hotels, but watchout for prices of certain items (Water is 4.5$, Nail polish is 50$...!!)
plus^depends what you're looking for. If you want a big casino, located on the strip and plenty of restaurants, bars close to everything then, that's the place.
minus^room is bit small, hotel overall is very dark and it's typical casino, bar style. the hotel is huge so always count on 10' to get anywhere inside. Very expensive and overcharged. Always keep an eye on your bill! They block you room access for any reason.
plus^Location was fantastic - right in the heart of the strip with lots to see and do. Room was clean and comfortable. Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill a great dinner option with reasonably priced very tasty food and good service
minus^No kettle provided and in spite of the so called resort charge of $35 they wanted to charge an additional $30 to get a kettle ☹️
plus^There was a lot to do at the MGM Grand.
minus^Lamp bulb was out and they said they would fix it first thing the next morning, but they didn't come until the next evening because of a problem with the water temperature in our wash basin. It took forever to walk to our room.
minus^We were welcome by Lea at reception and she was extremely helpfull on top of being very efficient and funny. That was a very good start in that amazing hotel !
plus^Great place to stay in Vegas! Great location, amazing pool, fun casino, pricey but great food, and comfy beds and rooms(:
minus^Restaurants are a bit pricey, but it's Vegas!  Didn't provide any bathrooms and it cost $14 for hot water
plus^The room was big enough for two people. The bed was comfortable. No outside noise. The wardrobe was large. When you are in the hotel you can check in with kiosk and you can check out even on the television, internet and personally.
minus^I didn't like the bathroom. It was kind of old and the shower tub was painted concrete.
plus^I liked having access to the monorail from the hotel. I liked that my room did not smell like cigarette.
minus^I didn't like the price for the room. The room was not luxurious at all and very basic. I did not like that the bathroom was not completely closed off. At the entrace of the room the shower and bathroom are there. The furniture seemed outdated. I don't think the value of the room is right. Too much for that specific room. I also did not like that we were charged $10 per night of parking. For being a guest I think that fee should have been waived.
plus^The view was good. The room was nice. The water was hot.
minus^Pricey. Weekend room rate was many times the weekday rate and fees and taxes should be added into the room quote or approximate amount for them given when hotel shopping.
plus^The staff were excellent. Very friendly.
minus^The room was missing the remote control for the tv.  The walls seemed thin as there was a lot of noise that came through from the hallway. It was hard to sleep with all the noise.
plus^The front desk staff was excellent. Acknowledged the reason for our visit-my wife's birthday. He was great! He even gave us an upgrade and a $25 cake credit.
minus^We had to call housekeeping twice before getting our blankets.
plus^The staff were friendly and helpful.
minus^The hotel is starting to get run down compared to the others. It needs updating. Our room needed major repairs to the plumbing, shower door and the safe didn't work (called three times to get it fixed....they never came but when I complained they took the resort fee off the bill).
minus^At first very bad room which was still not cleaned after I arrived at 4PM (checkin at 11AM). No windows at all. Old furniture, ... Not nice. Got an upgrade to better room: still you notice that this is a hotel from te past. Needs urgent renovation.
plus^Location
minus^Different softness of pillows (yes, I have stayed in a hotel with different softness in pillows). Vanity bigger and take light out of mirror and put above mirrow.
plus^It's on the strip. It has restaurants...
minus^Small rooms, smoke smell even in non smoking rooms. Details tell much, like cracks in the floor in the bathroom, broken shower handle etc.
plus^The bed was so comfortable and it had alot of closet space. I really liked the magnifying mirror.
minus^The bathroom was small and the set up was odd. The only toiletries available was one soap and lotion.
plus^The location
minus^I was double charged before I arrived, then while checking in I was charged AGAIN $1898.00 for a $79 room... which flagged my CC for fraud and my card was restricted for most of my stay! Thanks MGM! 😒👎
plus^It was amazing we always stay at the mgm loved all the shows they had for saint patricks day
minus^The room was i believe in reapir the screen on the bathroom wall was broken. then after takeing a shower went to wipe the mirror with a towel an end up almost falling cause the mount for the bathroom window was missing so the hole mirror tilted up causeing me to almost fall .the mirror by the closet the gold trim for the mirror was hanging off. an at night it was ridiculously loud after 12 aclock hard to get rest on a amazing bed it was room 519 on the west wing
plus^Great big bathroom.  Bed was great.  Many TV channels.  wifi  is decent.   Early check in allowed was great.
minus^10 minutes walk from my room to their spa n  fitness center was ridiculous
minus^The room was extremely old with the shower floor peeling and the carpets were old, filled with dirt and smelly.  Very dissatisfied for the amount we paid.
plus^Beds & pillows were great very comfortable sleep
minus^Nothing major but parking garage little far and location not as cents as some other hotels no coffee in room
plus^Cleanliness of the hotel was excellent.
minus^Some of the restaurants were lovely to look at and underused I would think this was due to the prices of some meals. I t may be wiser to drop some prices and have more customers in the places.
plus^Almost everything!!!!
minus^I had a leak in my room.. by the time I noticed it the following morning all my clothes had gotten wet.... it rained the 17-18 so I'm assuming it was a roof leak.. I was very disappointed about this... but besides this  isolated incident the hotel was perfect for me!!!
plus^When we first arrived our room's view was a building..😕so we went to customer service & they were so accommodating that we were given a different room which was only $15 extra a night! Beautiful view! The room was clean and the bed was comfortable! The MGM has everything that you want in that place! It's so large...if you didnt want to go anywhere else you wouldn't have to! I would definitely stay here again!
minus^The first time we got there we were on the 3rd floor and it had a smell that I didn't like...but the room was clean...
plus^Close to monorail, easy to get around in hotel. great location on the s strip, close to several sights.
minus^Room temp would no drop below 75 degrees. The buffet food was just fair for the price. Some items were great but some had no flavor. Booked a king room but got a double queen instead.
plus^good place
minus^don't even have flipflop, no remote controller for air conditioner, the voice of its fan is noisy and loud. the water was cold, claimed at 9, came until 10, was about to check out that time. Not worthy for its price.
minus^An amazing hotel, lovely layout, nice big rooms and very friendly staff. The hotel seems to go on for miles, what a great experience for first time in Vegas. Thank you MGM Grand.
plus^Nice resort have stayed many times. My number one option in Vegas for  over many years..
minus^Got a room in which I expected something  at least with a view..none...the restrooms are uncomfortable with no privacy ...paid a high price for nothing..dissapointed in the room experience
plus^Great location, comfortable room. 
minus^Little bit expensive but still a nice hotel. Didn't have a great view from the room and the window was quite dirty 
minus^The prices are too high.  We had two hamburgers and one beer, and the total was $70 with a tip.  WAY TOO EXPENSIVE.  Next time we will stay off the strip.
plus^Service was great, food was wonderful, location was on point . And the events were amazing . So much to do. Not even enough time !!
minus^While gambling , didn't have enough servers offering drinks.
plus^Check in/out was super easy and done on line!  You were advised when your room was ready via text
minus^Mattress was too stiff, sink did not drain very good.
plus^The bed was super comfy. And the room was quiet. It had a great view.
minus^The resort fee was higher. Had to pay taxes on two thing: the room and resort fee. Then I was told parking was included but it wasn't and had to pay an extra 10 dollars when we left.
plus^Great location, tons of activities without even leaving the complex (if you want!), easily accessible.  And it's the famed MGM Grand!
minus^There are newer/more luxurious hotels on the Strip.
plus^We were upgraded to suite. It was great to have the extra space and view from our window.
minus^There should have been some extra amenities like a coffee pot and refrigerator.
minus^Excellent facilities on site at the hotel everything from the pools to the food was fantastic. There was a lovely atmosphere that added to the experience.
plus^Beds really comfy everything you need under one roof. Close to everything walk right out into the strip.
minus^Didn't realize that we had only paid for 1 night when paid for booking thought we had paid for all 3 so it was a bit of a surprise when we were told we had to pay another  $900.
minus^Didn't get room allocated until 10pm after having to wait at reception for nearly 30 minutes, this was after waiting nearly an hour at initial check in when I was told room was not ready. Cold shower in room,no hot water. Swimming pool closed.
plus^The was nice, it's just too far away.
minus^I was not happy with one of the staff in front desk. He would not validate our parking ticket because we already checked out. The personnel that I talked to on the phone prior to checking out said that it's okay just go to the frontdesk and it will be validated, she was wrong. Also, they shouldn't charge a resort fee if we don't want to use it, its a rip off.
plus^Location 
minus^I did not like that I had asked for a check in time of 2am on the 24th and was granted it through booking.com. I then drove 10 hours from Northern California with my wife after working 8 hours only to be told by the hotel they don't do check ins until 3pm. We were told to wait for a few hours and maybe we could get a room. After wandering around the casino from 1:30 am to 4:45 am we were able to have the manager upgrade our room so we could get some sleep. We had to pay for an extra night even though it was The 24th, the day we were supposed to check in to begin with???? Booking.com and the hotels they do business with need to communicate their policies with each other before giving false beliefs that what was asked would actually be granted. 
plus^Nothing special
minus^Almost everything rated with how much can spend , didn't find it value for money, resort fee especially is a kind of daylight robbery or tricky way of making easy money, you get a price for room but unfortunately you have to tripple that offer as with tax, resort fee and other speacil taxes they apply but they can't even clarify what is what! bE AVARE !!!!
plus^The room was clean. The bed was very comfortable. The towels were soft and had a buttery popcorn scent, as crazy as that may sounds. It was amazing.
minus^Could of had a few more pillows for the bed.
minus^Poor house keeping. When my room was given to me it wasn't even clean. Second room was unnapropriate. Third room had a full odor smell. Food was really nasty.
minus^***RACHEL***FRONT DESK IS VERY PROFESSIONAL MADE US FEEL COMFORTABLE GAVE US OPTIONS  FELT WE RECEIVED BEST DEAL POSSIBLE VERY VERY POLITE AND CHARMIN.
plus^Excellent everything! Room , staff and buffet.
minus^Didn't like the fact that we had to pay parking seeing that almost every hotel in Vegas is free. But I guess with the events they have it's smart
plus^The staff at the front desk were the best part of the stay.
minus^The wait at the front desk to check in was over an hour. I do not know this for sure as I used mobil check in which only took 5 min. Thank you for that! My issue is that I got in a line that had know markings that was small, I thought I could ask a question. When I reached the front a women from the check in line accosted me and started yelling at me about how long she had waited and how dare I get in this line. My thoughts were that I could ask question if this were the wrong line and they would tell me where I needed to go. The front desk staff were very helpful and kind. It is not the hotels fault that this women was a pathetic piece of trash but maybe she would not have screamed at me if her wait had not been so long. This incident ruined the trip.
plus^Lots to do in hotel with loads of facilities. Great central location on strip.
minus^I checked online. My friends waited to do it at hotel and all got upgraded, I didn't.  Asked for late check in told me that they couldn't do it even though I had friends who had. Had to ask three times. Deactivated card for late check in and security guard basically accused me of breaking in. Buffet for breakfast was awful.
plus^the western omelette was the best omelette I ever tasted.The omelette guy was very friendly with us and he knows how to make an omelette.
minus^the carpet in the hallways are old and could be upadated and smell more fresh.
plus^I love everything about the room but I wish I got the one with the jacuzzi in the room that would've been better.
minus^Me and my spouse hated the buffet! It was the worst! I know we can't expect to much when you hear buffet but the food was horrible and for the price you would think it would've been much better. So I rate the buffet at a 1 and only because it was clean.
plus^Front desk employees were friendly & accommodating for my first time stay. Also, your housekeeping staff were friendly &  helpful as inquired for a hair dryer. I ran to get some coffee. Then by the time I returned a hair dryer was placed at the foot of my hotel room door as my companion was still sleeping & didn't want him disturbed.  Also, the Wellness room was a top notch room. I enjoyed the cleanliness of the room as I have allergies well as the air purification,   aromatherapy,Vitamin C  infused shower & white light room lighting. The Wellness bed was very comfortable & I obtained a great night of sleep.
minus^I wish this room would of had black out curtains which would have been good.
plus^The cost
minus^The west wing is outdated and not maintain very well. The roomcleaning made sure it was clean. But wallpaper peeling and title missing grout. The room was poorly lite and very small.
minus^It's on the main strip, there is no need for transportation when you get to the hotel, the parking was perfect and spacious and where ever you went it was clean . Even the hallways smelled so nice unlike other hotels in Vegas that it smelled like cigarettes.
minus^Everything cost too much. There was a charge for parking and monorail. Food was really expensive.  $200 check in fee was not disclosed in online booking info. I will not stay there again.
plus^The bed was comfortable and the room was clean.
minus^Didn't like the way the bathroom was set up. House keeping didn't give new towels when the room was cleaned.
plus^The friendly staff and food where we ate.
minus^WiFi didn't work with password I was given, hot water never did get hot in shower and bed was too low and not that comfy.
plus^Big bed, big shower
minus^Room was beside elavator, constant beeping noise at all hours and people shouting/ talking. Bedsheets not changed for the week.
plus^Cleaning folks very friendly always said hello.
minus^The person who checked me in was very rude.  The room was small.  Need more counter space in the bathroom.  The shower had very little pressure.
minus^Room smelt like sewage. Reserved a tower suite a for a view of the loading docks where the trucks came and the air conditioner vents. Got there after midnight for the first day of our reservation and got charged extra for room no show even though we showed up that night. Service everywhere was terrible. Could never find a server on the casino floor. Buffets were way overpriced for the quality. Food was disgusting. Our jets in the jacuzzi in the room would work on and off. Terrible hotel.
plus^Location was good
minus^The distance I had to walk to get to my room because I was told I had booked an economy room - this was not mentioned when I booked through bookings.com and the price I paid wasn't economy- I have stayed st MGM previously and it was an overall better experience. The security latch on my room was broken and I did move to another room with a $20 voucher
plus^Booking .com doesn't make you aware that you are booking but it's not being paid for through site. You are paying in person and I bought this trip for my elderly parents and the room had to be charged on their card when they arrived.
minus^The staff didn't handle this properly. I had to fly to Vegas from la to accommodate my parents.
plus^rooms were clean, modern; water was hot; staff friendly; room and halls bright; staff helpful with questions
minus^For a non smoking hotel, the rooms and the floor were fragrant with cigarette smoke.  I understand the casinos will be smokey but the rooms and our floor were also-couldn't get away from it
plus^Great location for walking the Vegas strip
minus^Parking difficult and a long way from the room. Poor choices for a breakfast. Sat at a restaurant in the lobby for so long without service that we gave up and grabbed a coffee at Starbucks
plus^The price.
minus^The rooms need to be updated.  There were many features in the room that were damaged/broken/dirty.  Door lock was broken off, electrical wires exposed because of broken receptacle cover that was not repaired, walls had numerous dirty streaks on them, bathroom drains did not drain properly and had to stand of pool of water when I showered.  I will never, never, never, stay here again.  Gross.
minus^Every stay thus far has been super, however the walk down the West Tower hall was a bit creepy and the smell of cigarettes and marijuana permeated through the walls.  Note to self do not book the West Tower again.
plus^The place was clean rooms are nice
minus^I dont like that apart from booking the room you have to pay a resort fee per day plus tax . And even though your a guest you have to pay for parking 18$ valet per day no in and out or 10$ to self park.
plus^Loved the casino and the room was clean and comfortable.  Room service food was very good too!  Love the 24/hr menu.  Plenty to do just in the hotel itself.
minus^There was no refrigerator or microwave in the room.  However, the staff brought a fridge without charging us.  The mattress was not very comfortable to me.  It was firm but not very soft.  Perhaps more pillows on the bed would offset the lack of mattress softness.
plus^All staff we encountered was friendly and helpful, beds were very comfortable
minus^Could'nt get television to work,wanted to get the weather,but did'nt bother reporting it, we had our laptop with us.
plus^The view and location are stunning. The dinning in the hotel was great. Staff and service was super helpfull and freindly. There was an issue with my room when i checked is so the upgraded me to a georgous suite at no cost.
minus^I wish there was a casino that was none smoking, or at least a non smoking area. I my self am a smoker but I found my eyes would burn just walking around. I can only imagine how non smokers feel. The smell of smoke sticks to your cloth its really strong oder.
plus^The room was overall decent but not for the value.
minus^I basically paid $250 a night to be in the grand king room, but the basic rooms at the Cosmopolitan are better and similarly priced. The bed in the grand king is ok, not uncomfortable but not amazing. The couch in the room was actually more comfortable.
minus^Room was Clean and I was Upgraded to Grand Tower on the 15th floor, free of cost. Strip View you can't beat from higher floor, the more the better
plus^Good staff Comfortable bed Big room Good breakfast to the room
minus^- No place in refrigerator for own food - View from the window, colleagues were also complaining - Shower was awful as it's right from the wall, no chance to clean hear without going inside the bath & hard to fix cold/warm water as your hands appear exactly under shower
minus^TV and wifi wasn't working when I get to my room! The staff doesn't  sound  concerned, their manager even less! Got TV and wifi one day and a half later with no compensation! The room for king room was below expectation, no electric curtains, and not even a kettle available. For staying at other hotel in Vegas, this hotel is a waste of money
plus^Loved the room and the bed was amazing! Had dinner at the atilier by Joel Robuchon and it was hands down the best meal of my life!!
minus^Very busy hotel, everything inside very expensive, even Starbucks is more pricey than usual which is annoying. Had lunch at Emerils which we thought was pretty aweful and very overpriced.
plus^The room was lovely. Staff friendly and overall a nice hotel. For reasonable money in vegas.
minus^The room was clean, but needed a deep clean. Dust had settled around the place  Also having paid a resort fee and booking the MGM based on its pool being open this time of year, it was dissapointing to be told there was maintenance.
plus^Clean, well appointed room. Very comfortable bed. A little dark and a little dated but fine. 
minus^It's the largest hotel in the world - it's a little bewildering. 
plus^The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was nice and modern. Loved the double mirrors closet door
minus^It smelled like sewer in the shower. Need better pillows
plus^Great location and the staff were great.  The room was very good, good size and very modern.  It felt like I was staying in the hub of Vegas
minus^Nothing, would stay there again.
plus^Everything was really good and comfortable.
minus^I couldn't call down to the valet to have my car brought around. I also had to pay daily instead of having the parking put on my room and was never told how to change that.
plus^Location
minus^1. Internet is a joke, It does NOT work. In the room fairly work and you've to reconnect often. But in public areas forget about the free Wi-Fi they offered.  2. Staff not friendly.  3. Facilities needs mainteinance:  a.the 2nd day almost next to me a piece of the ceiling fell down... and 5 days later the hole was still there. b. The quality of indoor air is horrible. Even in our non-smoking floor the air is contaminated. c. The elevators worked pretty bad. Problems to close doors, One was out of service. 4. They charge everything, but the cost does not worth the services nor the facilities.
plus^The staff were friendly.
minus^The room is made to seem like a luxurious hotel room in the advertisement but in short the room looked and felt like an oversized closet. The shower (no bathtub) leaked water, not enough water pressure and you can hear all the noise in the hallways. Absolutely no view.
minus^The hotel was overall AMAZING!!!! From check-in to check-out the staff was extremely courteous. I would definitely stay here agian when I visit Vegas.
plus^The window covering blocked out all of the light while you were sleeping.
minus^There was blood on my bathroom floor that wasn't from me or my family. Which is disgusting and tells me the room wasn't cleaned properly. The beds are very hard and the staff that we talked to was mostly rude.
plus^I loved the room and the amenities within the MGM buildings. Everything was so convienient. We didn't have to leave for anything. Our favorite was the night club, Hakkasan a bit pricey but amazing. My wife and I love to dance and that place was the place to be.
minus^My wife did not like the bed. Also in our bathroom the door latch was bent and the tub drained slow.
plus^The room service was excellent.  Staff professional at tentative and respectful.  Food delicious.  Overall outstanding mini vacation can't wait to come nack.
minus^N/A
plus^The room itself was large and very quiet. The bed was huge and very comfortable for me, a declared enemy of soft matresses as I am. Reception, housekeeping, and maintenance staff most professional and friendly. WLAN inside the room and within the west wing worked well. Hotel location was perfect, right next to the Strip and close to some convenience stores and relatively cheap food joints; and with a monorail station at the door, which is a very convenient ride to the congress center.  Plenty of restaurants (expensive and not so expensive) within the premises in case that you need to have a late dinner and don't feel in the mood to go out. Also full of attractions, as expected in such venue.
minus^Isolation at the window was not that good and you could feel a draught coming from the outside all the time. Being that window right behind the bed, that meant that you had to fully close the shutters if you didn't want to freeze your scalp during the night. WLAN outside the west wing (even still inside the hotel) did not work and nobody seemed to be able to solve the issue - in the reception they said that I should call IT myself, which left me perplexed. For the price of the room, the amenities set was quite scarce (just your usual shampoo and soap bar, no shower gel, no toothbrush or toothpaste, and nothing unusual like slippers). And also be aware that if you go there during event weeks (like CES), the price will rise spectacularly on congress days (OK, but you should know that already while booking).
plus^Location to Transit for the Convention Center, Restaurants, nice variety.  Top Golf was excellent.
minus^Cleanliness of room, noticed that in all corners of our washroom there was a dirt build up, made me wonder about the rest of the room.  We arrived early, had to check our bags and wait for our room, had friends arrive early as well after us and they received a room asap, not sure how the pecking order works....
plus^Room quality and view were great. Ck out at the hotel was easy. You have a lot of choise's of quality restaurants in the hotel
minus^The crowd. I'm not that big of a crowd person. It was hard to find a seat at a bar.
plus^Reception were responsive and Maintenance fixed problems with our bathroom quickly.
minus^Our bathroom smelled funny, of drains, and we had no sink plug initially.  Extra charges on top of the basic room price came as a surprise.
plus^Room service. The beds were comfortable. The bsthroom is perfect size and love the exhaust system, no fogged up mirrors!
minus^Some of the housekeeping staff is not very friendly. They should  greet ALL guests in the hallways and I shouldn't have to say it first for them to greet me. Paying for parking when you're a guest is not cool either. Need more restaurant choices open after 10pm! Only the fast food court and wolfgang puck is open after 10pm.  Lastly Wolfgang puck is OVER priced for sure.
minus^Overpriced comparing to the other hotels same quality.  Not enough food options.  To many prostituts early in the morning at the Lobby Bar.  Kept us away.
plus^Great staffs, room neat. Very large hotel, has night club, show location and various restaurants.
minus^No shower gel was provided , just thick soaps to wash hands. The bill was a bit ridiculous, I upgraded when I got to the hotel but the upgrade incurred more room tax on top of the room tax already being paid for on the previous booking. Isn't it meant to be one room tax billing, plus I was not made aware of that at the time, I probably wouldn't av upgraded
minus^shower was not cleaned once our whole stay, the shower floor was slimy and it was dirty room smelt of cigarettes. staff were not helpful when we first arrived.
minus^The location was horrible I've never stayed in that part of MGM Grand ever.That was my last time staying in that part of the hotel.If I can't stay in the Grand tower I will look for another hotel.
plus^No real negatives.....
minus^MGM Grand seems to have lost its way a little compared to the other high-end hotels on the strip... slightly, dare I use the word, 'chavvy'?   Drinks like all places on the strip were stupidly expensive!
plus^Spacy room, excellent WLAN, good food in Restaurants.
minus^it is very clairaudient in the hotel room - you can even hear nabour's snoring, tv noise from other room and all talks of the nabours. Hotel can't be recommended to People with light sleep! Water saving showerhead requires 5 Minutes more time in bathroom... Recommendation: Mobile check-in! in rush hours 30-60 minutes waiting time at check-in (see photo).
plus^Staff were friendly. Had easy access to the othe main casinos via walkover bridge.
minus^Everything was expensive. No $5 or $10 tables. Restaurant and food choices were poor. Nothing special about this hotel. Spent most of our time across the road at the other casinos.
minus^We ended up with an upgrade as the room we booked wasn't available. The lady on reception was so friendly and welcoming, I think her name was Michelle.  The room was nice and clean and spacious. Very comfy bed! Great Hotel, would stay here again.
minus^The customer service was absolutely terrible. Cancelled one of my rooms over a week before the cancellation day and was still charged a cancellation fee. Contacted customer service and was told it would take 3 days to be credited to my account. It has now been over 2 weeks and after contacting customer service multiple times, I have still not received a reimbursement or even a reply. I would not recommend this hotel to a friend.
plus^As I had booked online, check in at the lobby was very smooth. The room was nice and clean. The towels and sheets looked, felt and smelled clean. The bathroom was spotless. I also liked that there was the option of late check out (but for the cost of 25$).
minus^For a 4 star hotel, I was surprised that there were no complimentary bottles of water unlike others I've stayed at. A bottle of water in the room costs 8$ and 6$ in the lobby. There were no complimentary toiletries other than shampoo, conditioner and lotion. No toothbrushes, shower cap or q-tips. These are very minor things but for the price that's charged and comparing other hotels that are also 4 star, MGM fell short in this area.
plus^West wing was right at the strip when you went outside, didn't have to go through the whole hotel/casino.
minus^No coffee machine, fridge or microwave in the room.
plus^Beautiful clean room.
minus^Minibar had sensors and was unlocked. Any slight movement triggered the sensor to add minibar charges. However it was easily corrected at front desk.
plus^Casino was good
minus^My room was terrible.. It was like a small cubby hole and absolutely not worth the exorbitant price I paid for it. The other rooms on the same floor were much larger but for some reason I was given a very small room. Pathetic experience and I feel robbed
plus^very huge hotel.staff answers all your question and helps you with anything.
minus^no good airconditioning it was very old.the room was too far from the elevator.
plus^We have stayed at the MGM Grand four times in the past and we would recommend it to anybody who is going to Las Vegas. The staff, rooms, food, entertainment could not have been better.
minus^There is nothing about the MGM Grand that we dislike or could moan about.
plus^the rooms were big than standard. location of the hotel itself was good. but other than those, it was really a big disappointment for us considering this was MGM!!
minus^the location of the hotel is good, but the location of the West Wing rooms are really bad.. it was at the far end of the hotel! it was not as what their site had advertised housekeeping was not as good as other hotels i've stayed in.. bath amenities like shampoos were not changed and replaced..  though you had already used them.. no slippers nor coffeemaking machines.. hairdryers are old and really noisy! the sink in our room was clogged!
plus^The restaurant choices were good
minus^The shower was dirty and would not drain the bedding was stained. It took 2 hours, 3 calls to the front desk before anyone came to our room to check on these issues.
plus^I liked the fact the property was so huge you could numerous things inside the hotel, and if you go out the back exit you're right in front of 24 hour restaurants and retail clothing stores (in case you forgot something at home :)
minus^For some strange reason I wasn't able to check out on my phone, but they did have an express check out where u fill out a quick form and drop your key, and they email you your bill so that did make me feel better :)
plus^The hakkasaan club in the MGM was awesome! The staff there were incredible and the club experience was spot on. The casino floor was good with good dealers and various slots.
minus^Our room was not clean when we arrived. There were open soaps on the sink and half used hotel size shampoo and comditioner in the shower. There was also an open band aid on the night stand. We reported this to the front desk and all they did was send housekeeping up with new soap and shampoo. Not good customer service in my opinion.
minus^Dated rooms, even after re-model. It was very noisy in the room, mainly from doors closing in other rooms down the corridor, and the AC unit was very loud. Low height shower with low water pressure, and had broken shower controls even after re-model  I know this hotel isnt the newest on the block, but i still expected a little more. Shame.
plus^Location of property and facilities inside e.g. restaurants, bars casino etc.
minus^Very expensive security deposit for the room which isn't ideal if you don't have the funds available.
plus^the price
minus^I paid for my parking at the machines by the garage and the hotel then charged me for parking and never told me the parking would be charged to my bill. Wi Fi didn't work for two days.  There was nothing listed about the construction in the hotel.
plus^Bed was awesome. Staff was super friendly and helpful. Shower pressure was good. Super clean hotel and room.
minus^Need more pillows on the bed. It's insane to me to pay that much money for a room and not be able to get some sort of breakfast for free. Maybe even one free trip to the buffet for breakfast.
plus^Nothing, I would recommend everybody to book the Cosmopolitan Hotel 
minus^In all seriousness, this hotel doesn't even offer shower gel (if you don't believe me call them)... When calling the lobby they claim that's only something they give to people who rent the most expensive suites.. Are you joking me? Shower was built for midgets, same with the bathtub. Wasn't even able to open a window for an inch, a dirty air filter was the only option for fresh air. Trying to order roomservice, I was waiting literally 15 minutes before I was able to order.. I can write a whole book with the things I disliked about this hotel. The only good thing about this hotel/casino is the nightclub called Hakkasan which is located here. Be smart and book a different hotel. 
plus^Location, on the strip
minus^The hotel room was not clean enough and, even though I called Guest service, no one showed up.  The room has a tiny window and it is very dark. The corridors are never ending and no one offered to carry our luggage.
plus^Great location for shows etc.
minus^Aged facilities. Apparently some front desk staff are not smart enough for their job. We were told to pay parking up front, which we did, but our room key never worked at the garage. Get charged twice on the $10 parking fee.
plus^Room size was good and bed comfy all as i expected for the price i paid
minus^Room.temperature. was extremely cold even when i turned air con off Grand tower is quite a walk away
plus^The customer  service is excellent.
minus^Didnt tell me that  i need to pay the water and chips in my room and im trying to explain why im late to check-in  they didnt even ask the manager if they i reimburse  or dont charge me anymore because its foggy and raining so hard.
plus^Great pillows.
minus^less things more expensive. No coffee maker in the room, no fridge, soft beds. AND the property tax is a bunch of BS. Plus I get an email a couple days before my trip that the price will be more because there was a tax raise. Nickel and dime you for everything. Its not worth it anymore.
minus^MGM Company Vision ...'We Engage, Entertain and Exceed the expectations of our guests worldwide.' Company Core Values ....'Integrity: We do not compromise our integrity, even for the sake of profit. The quality of our reputation is just as important as the quality of our resorts. Excellence: We do not compromise in our efforts to deliver superior service and an exceptional experience to our guests.' Just read the hotels mission vision on the website,and I have to say it made me laugh. I stayed in the MGM Grand hotel from 9th-14th Jan 2017 and checked out after a somewhat disastrous experience over the 5 nites with 5 family members celebrating a 40th birthday. We had saved up all year for the trip,and had looked forward to a week of fun during our stay.The hotel itself is huge with great services and is a great place for a blow out few days.After previously staying in other hotels on the Strip I was looking forward to staying in the prestigious MGM. We were staying in the West Wing area in the hotel in a quite modest but acceptable double room. However, from the start of our stay We found the security in the hotel extremely lacking at our location,with unlocked doors beside side entrances allowing people to wander in and out of guests room areas at free will. On one occasion we were harassed by a male for money after exiting the lift on the ground floor who had obviously walked in the unlocked entrance to the room area (which is meant to be secured by a broken room key swipe device to enter the area). This was all highlighted in our room being entered by someone who helped themselves to a large quantity of clothing,expensive handbags,cash,a mobile phone and other items that had been purchased over the few days at great expense.
plus^Bed was really comfortable. Housekeepers where friendly. Avenue Cafe was Amazing we LOVED NICK! The casino was probably one of the best on the strip. Also the express checkout kiosks were very convient! Also the layout of the hotel was nice; it made since when walking around. We were also offered a free 'Sweet Snack' from the cup cake place inside the hotel- On The House for our Birthday. Such a nice gesture!
minus^Went to Crush and the food was ok, but one of the steaks were not cooked correctly. Just not what we expectd.
plus^The hotel is beautiful, nice rooms and the location is great! It's located right in the middle of everything. We were celebrating my niece's 21 birthday, my daughter's and brother in law birthday too. Another wonderful memorable moments at the MGM💓
minus^The hotel wasn't able to put me in a room closer to my family. Otherwise, very nice experience!
plus^Wolf gang puck restaurant was good. They also had decent gambling areas.
minus^Water pressure in our room almost knocked you down but our friends room down the hall had no water pressure. The bed was horribly uncomfortable as were the pillows. In the double sink, my husband was shaving so when he released the water from his sink mine started backing up with what looked like sand. Also, when down stairs gambling waitresses were hard to come by even when I was winning big.  I actually upgraded our room and sad to say I won't stay there again.
plus^Staff very helpful and friendly. Great restaurants.
minus^Lots of fees that don't seem to offer anything in return (resort fee). Hidden fees. They'll talk you into the room with the nice view, but fail to mention there's a fee for that view! Bland interior. Lacks character vs other casinos. In the future I'll stay elsewhere.
plus^They got amazing shows such as Cirque Du Soleih - KA and David Copperfield
minus^Hidden Cost Resort Fees which wasn't shown on Booking.com at the time of booking.
plus^Relatively cheap hotel in Las Vegas Strip
minus^Noisy room. Very uncomfortable glass door in the toilet. The hotel was crowded. We had to wait long time for checking in/out.
plus^Nothing...my son got to go to his shoe store and we had a bed to sleep on was it. One had one nice person  help us and Sherrell was suppose to set up a return visit..she called I emailed her back and left her a message w the info she requested and haven't heard anything back from her.
minus^Was extremely disappointed n everything!
minus^Unfriendly staff Allows customers to smoke pot light went out in middle of night.  could not sleep due to A/C not working.  Would not give refund.
plus^bed like a cloud and good shower.
minus^Food over seasoned (ordered room service 2 am) no extra towels, had to use same for 2 days, couldnt open frigobar to see what's inside, wasnt notified about the 100 dollars deposit, was a surprise for me, and there was a  double charge of 36 dollars in my banking account the front desk couldnt explain and gave me my receipt in case I go further with dispute, instead of having a answer for extra charge. I thought my husband would have something, at least credit at the casino since we were celebrating his birthday. Usually the hotels we stay in always give a complimentary for celebrating birthday...
minus^Staff is not professional at all. I had a problem which caused by Hotel staff but they are just saying that I am not person in charge or not person who made mistake or etc. For the customer all staff is representative of hotel and we do not care who made mistake, we just want to hotel to solve the problem but this hotel doesn't.  I travel a lot in overseas and this hotel is worst hotel I ever had. I will never ever use this hotel again.
plus^Rooms were modern and clean. Resort is large with many food options. Brunch buffet options were ample. Nice casino floor.
minus^They will nickel and dime you to death. Charges guests $10 for parking on top of the already high resort fee. They have those pressure sensitive mini bars that charge you for even lifting the box to see the nutrition facts.
plus^Decent location. Quiet rooms.
minus^Avoid the West Wing rooms like the plague - unmodernised and very tired. Zero comfort amenities - no fridge / minibar / robe / shower caps / cotton.  Totally messed up my reservation. Booked 5 nights on Booking.com. They only had me down for 2 nights. Conveniently for them, they charged me $4k for a $2k booking (during CES). Absolutely appalling. Said it was a non smoking hotel. Rooms stank of stale smoke. Hateful place, and hope never to return.
plus^Parking was a hassle when room key did not work when exiting self-park garage.  Went to see clerk and was told I had to wait in line with all the new check-ins.
minus^I took two hours and fifteen minutes to check-in due to the crowd on New Years Day.  It did not seem like they had all hands on deck for this big crowd.
plus^The buffet was fine and the rooms were dirt cheap, until the resort fee is added on.
minus^Towels and bedsheets had stains on them. The smell of cigarette smoke throughout the whole place, even in the hallways of the guest rooms is disgusting. What's worse is the fragrance that is used to try and cover it. It would be good if you could wave the resort fee if you don't use it. It is the middle of winter and that's not something I'm going to use.
plus^fast check in and check out.  staff in lobbies are helpful. close to car park (south tower), easy to park by ourself. 
minus^can hear people who speak in next room. 
plus^Decent location. That's the only thing in its favour.
minus^Pretty much everything. Gross room. Tired, zero standard amenities (rubbish toiletries and nothing else, no shower cap or cotton pads or robe, no fridge, no mini bar - not even a box of tissues!!!!!)  Everything was tatty and smelt bad. Bathroom isn't even a separate room - it's two glass doors as you walk into the room one for the toilet and one for the shower. Towels are in the toilet??!
plus^The parking staff, the casino, the location
minus^The long wait for checking in, they never told me I needed to validate my room key for parking and charged me $10 to get out of parking although I had a room there, the hotel staff weren't warm enough
minus^Even I booked a suite  I had to wait 20 minutes out side in the cold waiting for the luggage man After that I have to wait one hour and ten minutes to check in  Also the bathroom light doesn't work:(
plus^The facility is huge but very well organised for such an operation. Numerous restaurants and food court,  first room was not really nice but no problem to change with a little $ 20.- additional.  Very nice and helpful staff. Very well situated on the beginning of the Strip.
minus^Food and drinks are really expensive !! Comparing to street prices.
plus^The room was nice...that's it. Maybe because I've stayed at the Cosmo for so long I have high standards? 
minus^No mini fridge sans the minibar which you aren't allowed to add items to or you are charged $30 restocking fee.. No coffeemaker so no hot water. It's Vegas so I expect expensive prices for food not a problem but they charge for parking now!?? $10 a day...oh and there is no in and out privileges which means if you parked your car for a day and 54 min like I did you have to pay $20 to leave and pay again when you want to leave again. Absolutely disgusting that really is the reason I will never stay at any MGM Resort again. I'll stick to the Cosmopolitian from now on.
plus^Good location, upstairs of the Ka theatre and other shows
minus^incredibly long check-in times (45 mins wait), just opening the door to the mini fridge will add $30 to your room fees, long long walk from the car park to the lobby.
plus^I like the location of the property.
minus^When I booked the room, I didn't realize that I would be paying almost 1200 dollars to stay in a low quality room. If I had realized this at the time of booking, I would have paid more for a better room.
minus^They put me in north tower, in the basement - the worst location, - you have to enter your room via a metal door! Tha t s a joke for,the,price.  As usual, personel is lying at check in to get you out of,their desk as soon as poss.
plus^Location was good as it's on the main Vegas strip. 
minus^May be just the room I booked. The hotel is undergoing Reno. The room I got was tiny and has no windows. When you have a shower water runs into the room. Front desk staff and not helpful. There are much better hotels in Vegas. 
plus^They comped the room for us
minus^If they had a room when I got there at 2030 but instead they said we had to take a taxi all the way around the strip that was closed to the mirage
plus^I liked the location
minus^The bed was so incredibly uncomfortable. The shower had zero water pressure and it never got hot - only Luke warm. And when I got my final invoice there were over $50 of charges for room service that I didn't use. Also had to still pay $20 for valet even though room was $600.
minus^- no housekeeping coming in to clean the restroom - the restroom doesn't have a working vent, so after every time you do it, you gotta keep the restroom's door open for a while..  - unexceptal delay in answering the phone, regadless whome you are calling (e.g. spa, bell desk, front desk, restaurant, etc.)
plus^First we arrived at 11pm from a long drive. As we get up to our room, the room was a mess, beds not made left over food from the previous person, the view was perfect so we had to move rooms to a clean one.  They had told us they would switch us rooms back the following morning as long as we called between 11-11:30. 11:30 came that next morning and the lady (Autumn) was rude and said they couldn't  switch us rooms, so my family and I were stuck with the view of the dumbsters and ac units. The 2nd night at 330 am an alarm woke my family and I. It was a lady intercom saying please exit the building do not use the elevator,  use the stairs with like a loud police alarm. So my family and I were terrified and we ran down stairs. So i called and complained letting them know that it was one of the worse stays in Vegas i had ever had. They did very minimal by not charging the resort fees. I paid 770 for my stay so i was very disappointed nothing else was done, needless to say i WILL NEVER EVER stay at the MGM again.
minus^Dirty rooms, bad customer service.
plus^Craft steak restaurant  the service and the food was amazing! The steak was to die for.
minus^The MGM is not what I expected at all. It is run down and smells so much of smoke and that was just entering. It is hardly on the strip and not really near anything. When we got there we were told we were upgraded however as a couple we were given two seperate beds and the TV didn't work. It took over 3 hrs for someone to come help with over 4 calls to reception. We got in late so had to stay up till 1am and watch The man fix it while we were in our seperate beds. Our room was filthy there was a used nappy/diaper in the bin with other rubbish. Mould on the shower curtain and just overall dirty room. You could hear everything from our room and the guest next door to us were smoking marujuana the whole 5 day stay and our room strongly smelt of weed the whole time, almost to a point where it was hard to breathe. The shower was so cold and no pressure, you felt dirtier after having one. This by far was the worst stay I have ever had for the price and reputation of this building.
plus^Great location, lovely room, insane casino
minus^Our room was very noisy, we could hear the Neighbour's every step and planes every few minutes. The casino is full of smoke and not too well ventilated
plus^It's a beautiful building. Not as clean as I would expect.
minus^Upon entering my room the carpet wasn't vaccumed the bathroom was dirty. The wall had dirty scuff marks the picture had a hole in it. They tried to charge me $72 extra for what? I don't know. It's not worth the money that they charge.
plus^Very clean, view was fine
minus^The bed was worn and not as firm on the side facing the other bed. Clean but not firm enough for me.  Smoke everywhere - I found that we would avoid most of the first floor because of it. I wanted to spend more time downstairs but couldn't.
plus^Fantastic service from all staff we dealt with during our stay. Upgraded our room and also gave us a late check out at late request also! The concierge couldn't have been any more helpful! Would highly recommend and would stay again.
minus^Being from the UK and being used to a non smoking environment in pubs etc the casino area is sometimes really bad with the smell of cigarettes
minus^We were not told about extra room rates and charges and therefore paid $450 more than we were originally expecting. When we were checking out and asking about the additional charges the lady was very rude.
plus^Ease of checking in and out.
minus^Paid a resort fee yet could not enter night club without extra fee. I no different than a walk in.  Room shower floor all cracked up looks bad.
plus^The location.
minus^My room carpet between bathrooms wall and bed was completely for wet due to some leaking coming from the shower, damaging some of our clothes, at least the room rate they should reembolsed but that wasn't offered to me.
plus^Rooms were a great size and the beds were so comfy! Which you definitely need after a night out to recover!
minus^Smoking in the public areas and the overpowering smell of airfreshners to cover up the stale smell of smoke!
plus^Great location
minus^Prostitutes and drug dealers all over the place, blatantly offering their services.  Intimidating on occasions too. Little control over their ability to gain access to guest floors.
minus^We ordered the room with a buffet and i really liked that. We got to eat either breakfast or lunch every day we were there for no extra charge, up to $74.00 per day. It covered both me and my husband.
plus^Wolfgang Pucks restaurant inside is excellent. Fair prices, great service and spectacular food.
minus^Shower was cold, took 15 minutes to heat up. Called the front desk, they said this was 'normal' for a hotel this size. I think the MGM needs to re-think normal.
minus^Smoking in casino Walk to room was so long that for the first time in my life. I had to rent a wheelchair!!! In our room, their was NO GUIDE to the hotel's restaurants, shows, features.  NO coffee machine in room.
plus^Location was okay but definitely not the best..prepare yourself for walking if you wanna see the whole strip.
minus^One of the dirtiest rooms I've ever been in. There was a blood stain on 1 of the pillows. Dust everywhere. I turned on the heater and it sprayed out all the dust in the air so we had to get up and leave the room because it was impossible to breathe. Bathroom floor had yellow stains on it. No fridge in the room.
plus^Staff are helpful.
minus^Everything else. First of all, there was no hot water in the two morning that we stayed. The buffet had nothing to eat and the meat sucks. Bed was not comfortable. We thought we are staying in a motel 6 or something. The worst of all is that we have to pay for the parking and the stupid resort fee. Are we really in Las Vegas MGM? At this rate good luck to the business cause we are not going back for this crap
plus^The casino area was fun. Staff in the hotel were all friendly.
minus^Our room in the west wing was disappointing. Very bad view. Just 2 flat pillows on the bed. Toilet basically connected to shower. Felt overall like the room was dark, dirty and overpriced. It was a depressing atmosphere so we went offsite for dinner. I felt badly because it was my boyfriend's 30th birthday.
plus^The beds were fabulous. The room was very modern in it's appearance with lots and lots of chrome and mirrors. We liked that there were two chairs to relax in. The bell staff were just wonderful people and very friendly and accommodating. Our toilet flusher wasn't working properly and they came and fixed it right away.
minus^The mini bar was FAR TO EXPENSIVE! You can't even put something in the fridge without them charging you to do it. Dumb! A bottle of water was $8.00. Now come on! So bring your own snacks and water. Needless to say, they didn't sell us anything.
plus^Main tower rooms are upgraded, we enjoyed ours
minus^Our king bed rom in the West tower was not available and in order to get a king bed room in the Main tower we had to pay an extra $20 per night. I did not buy into the excuse that they offered free of charge an upgraded double beds room in the Grand tower. It was too late in the night to continue argue and definitely I would not sleep in separate beds with my wife. It left a bad taste, a brand like MGM squeezing $20 extra, seriously?, not our fault you've overbooked. Oh and self parking now costs money, I've stayed 2 years ago at Luxor and it was free, I guess the economy is still bad in Vegas if they need to charge $10 per day for self-parking.
plus^Monorail
minus^Didn't really care for the property.  Did run of the house but did not receive an upgraded room as was described by booking.com.  Didappointed!!
plus^The Chapel Staff  (Holly) and facility was absolutely wonderful.
minus^I reserved 4 rooms ahead of time, our fast check-in didn't work and trying to get checked in and out was a disaster, CC wasn't even charged correctly and I had to call to fix the charge errors after we go home. The room keys didn't work half the time and we had no hot water the last day we were there. I was absolutely disappointed with the hotel side of our stay.
minus^When we checked into our fist room, heater was not working and the room had a smell of some gas. We called the front desk asking for someone to come. We were waiting for and engineer to check on the smell and fix our heater for 1 hour 30 minutes. We called the front desk again informing that no one came to fix the problem, but now we want to change the room. They promised our upgrade. Upgraded room had weird menthol smell. It was not cleaned up, even bedding was not changed from the previous guests. Used towels were on the floor of the room. Both sinks did not drain and were full of facial hair from shaving. When we filled the bathtub with water, there was hair swimming on the top. We are coming to Las Vegas few times a year for 11 years; however, it was the worst stay ever for us.
plus^The food was good. The room was nice and quiet.The staff was very helpful
minus^I didn't like the smoking in hotel.  Everything was very expensive.  It was going to cost $30.00 for pot of coffee delivered to room as there was no coffee maker in room.
plus^Service in Restaurants and Bell Staff is good; a really nice selection of Restaurants, a good location and a busy hotel
minus^Not keeping restaurants open.  Also in some slower period , guests should be able to dine at signature restaurants . Rooms are dark , not enough light. Also not really clean and not well maintained . Had issue with Check Out , however this seems more a problem that has to be solved by Booking.com
plus^It was really clean
minus^Customer service was trash  No microwave or refrigerator  Payed to have the room set up romantically it was the most basic set up, like they just didn't care but I had to be out the room two hrs for 5 min work
plus^The room was spacious and comfortable, the service is very good the front disks where very helpful and the hotel is very large
minus^I didn't like that I was charged for internet and telephone even though I didn't need them or used them
minus^No complimentary drinking water, coffee and tea maker. No utensils in the room. Did not get to use 2 buffet that comes with our room because of the slow facilitation of the queue.
plus^The room was clean and the bathroom was huge and super nice! Loved that we were on the 2nd floor down from the top we had a great view from our room!
minus^There were hidden fees, like a hotel booking fee that we paid online, as well as a fee we had to pay once we got to the hotel and checked in! Did not ruin the trip but definitely would've been nice to know going in!
plus^Walking in  to the hotel during Christmas I did not see the wow factor as I did with other hotels.  Cigarettes smell was almost to the point where I almost walked out not check in.  I will never stay here again along with my family.  I did not like anything!
minus^Please see above!
plus^Nothing special
minus^As a long editing brand on strip, the room/resort was disappointing.  Everything seemed old, pillow was not comfortable, nor the bed. Other hotels like crown plaza or holiday inns have much better bed. Bathing towels were in low quality too, so was the hair dryer. Staff was just so so not in particular friendly, compared with other casinos on the strip. All in all, this was my first stay at MGM and I'm disappointed. Will not stay here anymore given there are so many other choices.
minus^They checked us into a  room that was occupied.  The hot water went out in the middle of a shower.  The elevator door smashed and broke some belongings.  Signage is poor... impossible to try and find where you need to go.
plus^I didn't like the parking situation. Parking should be free since we are being charged the Phantom resort fee. Who ever decided to charge for parking at the casinos made a huge mistake. It's a huge inconvenience and for that I will not be returning to Vegas
minus^Paying for parking
minus^True..I only paid $70 for the room...I requested not to be at the end of a long hall..I had to walk down 2 long halls to get to my room...I didn't feel safe.
minus^King bed, spacious, nice shower. Check-in and out was fast and easy. Checked in online prior to arrival and received room keys via kiosk. Checked out through room TV. Printed boarding passes in lobby. Minimal human interaction (available but not needed). Walked to other hotels and noticed lines in lobby. Young professional traveling with girlfriend. First time to Vegas. Will return and remain loyal to MGM.
plus^Easy access to all the events and shows Vegas has to offer. Very easy access to shuttles and transportation.
minus^Very expensive.Room service was nice but food was not worth the price. Lots of added charges.
plus^Convenience to T-Mobile arena, rooms were generally clean, room service was very courteous.  No pets seen running around - FANTASTIC!
minus^Smoking just about anywhere on the main floor! Rooms are paper thin, so noise from adjoining rooms is obvious
plus^The bed was comfortable, and it was clean.
minus^There was some loud noises I think from heating vents. I recorded them the were so loud hoping a staff member would ask me about my stay. No one did. There were other noises in in the walls by the bathroom. Also, the breakfast place was not great and very expensive $50.00 for two people no drinks. The toast was cold and the hash dry.
plus^Location Cheap parking
minus^None of the prices came right. Quoted price and had a hard copy but still paid a lot more than confirmed before.  No fridge and no coffee maker in the room. I think I know why now.  Every thing was extensively overpriced.
plus^Staff bent over backwards to help us when we realised we'd made a small mistake in booking. Rooms were very comfortable. Concierge service was excellent as was room service staff.
minus^Difficult to keep the room at an even temperature. The vent to let air in must have been near the sensor so anytime the air cooled the room, it would overcompensate and heat up too much. Minor detail though - the rest was great!
plus^Friendly/Professional staff....front desk was great accommodating our request for adjoining rooms.  Excellent food at restaurants at a fair price.  Friendly and excellent casino dealers and pit bosses!  Our group of friends have been coming to MGM for years, and always have a great time!
minus^Wish I could request and confirm adjoining rooms during booking vs having to request it upon check in!
plus^Location, and common areas. check out in the TV. Service.
minus^Feel the rooms are a bit old .... I imagine something more modern. It is not too bad, but can be much better.
plus^The location, easy access to everywhere. Bars are cozy and relaxing down the hotel lobby.
minus^I don't like the room. There is nothing I could see from my window. The only thing I can see is a giant machine for the air condition or I don't know what machine are those. for the price you pay is not worth it. 😬
plus^Everything!  Nice, spacious suite with perfect view. Kind staff (especially the receptionist, big thanks to him). Swimming pool area with warm water. Tasty food in the buffett. Definitely we are going to return here!
minus^Nothing
minus^They advertise so many different activities as if they are included in the booking when they are just tenants of the same property. I expected more from such a well regarded hotel.
plus^Good food selection
minus^No heat in the room had to pack up my luggage and go to another room. Room was never clean for several hours had to wait in the hallway until the room service came and did a rush cleaning job
plus^Location, variety of things to do, and foods were excellent
minus^Staff in Lobby and Adult Beverage areas were extremely slow and very dependent on high tips.  No high dollar tip NO service.  Very sad!
minus^Paid for and was charged a late checkout.  Hotel mysteriously still checked me out and couldn't get into my room when I got to it.  Had to wait in line at the front desk for them to have to re-key my card and tell me I still had 15 minutes to get my stuff out.  Kind of bothersome.
plus^Location.  Easy access.
minus^We've stayed in Vegas for years during the National Finals Rodeo at many different hotels.  Never at any other hotel have we had to pay to park.  We always use Valet and the cost at other hotels is just a tip.  It cost us $18/day at the MGM.  So between the rip off resort fee and the parking it was an additional $50/day just to stay at your fine resort.  I remember when you could stay in Vegas for a total of $50/day.  Thank goodness for your eatery because we didn't want to pay $32/person for your buffet.  Who can eat that much food.  Expensive place to stay and our room wasn't any nicer than some of the other places we have stay in Vegas.
plus^Location  parking
minus^Food was over priced  had me in wring riom booked 8 mo advance to get a grand king had refuse stay in room gave me to get one i spent 7  nights there  nothing special about room wont stay there again
plus^I just liked everything about it the casino the building the food and the people that were there working were awesome I will be coming back again
minus^No fridge ration in the rooms...for food or drinks to take to her room
minus^Check in process took too long and attendant was lukewarm. Elevator door made loud popping noise every time it opened. When I turned on the bathroom sink the first thing that came out of the faucet was black water followed by lots of air. Bed was adequate but pillows were flat and hard. Took a good 3-4 minutes for water in shower to get warm enough to consider showering. After another 30 seconds of room temperature water, I was finally able to get water to desirable temperature. There were no USB ports in the room for charging electronics. That is a very major inconvenience for your guests that could be supplied relatively quickly and at a low cost. Checkout line was long as well. Considering our stay was during the national finals rodeo, I expected that management would have anticipated the crowds and made the necessary staff adjustments. This was my first stay at your hotel but have stayed at other hotels on the strip and found your hotel did not meet our minimal expectations.
plus^Nice room, helpful and friendly staff, excellent in-house restaurants, & convenient connection to the monorail.
minus^At the extreme Southern end of the strip, no smoke-free gambling area, very expensive for little things like a sofa.
plus^staff in general very helpful and friendly. the asian restaurant is fantastic plus the show KA amazing. All in Mgm
minus^the blankett is uncomfortable.. open on top and sheets r separating while u make yourself comfy for sleeping. hotel fee of 34$ per day on top doesn't make sense and is just another way to make money. food or just water at the stands, very expensive but I guess in every hotel the same.
plus^The room was spacious and comfortable.  The Wolfgang Puck restaurant has an amazing steak sandwich.  Being on the monorail helped me because I had a conference at the convention center.  The staff were all very friendly and approachable.
minus^We're not used to being around so many smokers so that took some getting used to.  Also, the concierge told us the monorail didn't travel south which didn't make sense and wasn't true.
minus^Thank you Darla! We booked months in advance as we were travelling for a friends hens night and I wanted a connecting room with another friend as we both had kids travelling with us. We contacted to hotel and they advised that the 2 room types we had booked connected perfectly and to contact the hotel the day prior to ensure they allocated the correct room types for us. The day prior we phoned reservations and the lady I spoke to was extremely rude and told me there was no way to amend my booking (cause I booked via booking.com) and that there was no way to get connecting rooms! Of course this news the day prior to arriving was distressing! Upon checkin my friend and I said a little pray that we would have someone friendly willing to help us to ensure our weekend plans could still go ahead. Then we met Darla! What a friendly, helpful and understanding lady. Not only did she help and get us connecting rooms for a little extra she upgraded us to the 'stay well' level which has an air filter, air freshener and best of all the floor is non smoking! With kids this was a must! The main room had a king bed, massive spa, large lounge area and the other room had 2 queen beds which is what we requested. Thanks Darla! You made our trip! I hope Hotel Management read this and pass on our thanks again xxx
plus^Location
minus^Everything! The shower booth isn't clean, and water doesn't flow so it stuck. Tub also stuck. I asked to fix twice but nothing changed.  I would never stay at this hotel again. Waste of my money. 
plus^Wifi was pretty fast. Room excellent. Services were very prompt and pricing very reasonable. Visited various so called better hotels but pricing differential was not justified - difference on 3 day stay paid for one helicopter visit to Grand Canyon! In house shows great (  but tickets cheaper on The Strip)
minus^Typical US standard  facilities in room I.e. No kettle and fridge only for selling booze not to put own water in! But at least had ironing facilities
plus^The bed was fine.
minus^Woke up to see a roach scramble to hiding. Shower floor had stains. Shower head sprayed all directions. No complimentary bottle of water. $32 hotel fee.  I stayed in room for a total of 9 hours. I don't recommend if you just need 1 night.
plus^It was great value for Vegas.  Room was comfortable.  I like to walk the strip, so MGM is a good place to start and end a round trip of walking.
minus^Room was a bit dated and the shower temperature constantly fluctuated.
plus^Amenities and clean
minus^We stayed for a week, and they put is the worst rooms in the west wing. These rooms are fine for a weekend, however not having a bathroom for a week wasnt fun or comfortable. I'm a return visitor to the MGM however this was  ow my last. The front desk where lovely when we checked out, and awful when we checked in.
plus^Great large room, excellent King bed, loved the modern furniture. Never heard a sound from other rooms or hallway.
minus^Blackout drapes would really help. Green lights are shining through the windows until middle of the night.
plus^Nothing really. I expected more from the name and its alleged reputation.
minus^The bathroom did not have a fan, so it steamed up, and the shower had mold in it. The outlets in the room are old and worn out. My pulg would not stay in and kept falling out.
minus^I ordered two rooms, they tried to upgrade me to put us next to each other, double charged me for resort fee, I had to show them the receipt from booking .com to reverse the charges. it is very annoying to grab the customer and try to up sell and hustle at check in specially you have been driving for several hours to get there!!! I have been at other hotels  and quite different and even offer promotional items to feel you good, rather than trying to gauge you at the check in counter.
plus^The room was comfortable, but it was a little shocking that we were not allowed  to keep a nutritional supplement for my pregnant wife in the room refrigerator.
minus^The smell of cigarette smoke everywhere.
plus^Perfect location on the strip. This hotel lobby is beatiful and one of the prettiest casino's on the strip.
minus^The bathroom was not cleaned. There were pieces of toilet paper on the floor around the toilet.  They had been used and had you know what on it.  Disgusting. We called the front desk at 4 PM and asked housekeeping to come back and that we were leaving. They said they would reclean the bathroom. We came back at 1:30 AM and one little piece of toilet paper had been removed, but the brown one that had been used was still there.  So If they didn't clean the bathroom either time, then I can imagine the sheets on the bed or the floor wasn't vacuumed either.
plus^Location, staff are awesome, gaming floor great and room was very clean. It's my 3rd stay @ MGM
minus^I'm pretty happy overall but if I had to pick there not enough towels in room to begin with. Few broken things like lamps and power points
plus^Beautiful place to stay. Loved the location and everything it has to offer (casino, nightclub, restaurants, lounge, ice cream store). Everything in one place. 
minus^The only negative comment I have from this hotel is the location of the pool. You have to walk through the casino, bars, stores, etc, in order to get to the pool. With such big hotel, you would expect them to have several pools through out the hotel so there isn't so much walking to get to the pool, specially in swimsuit. I personally, packed my swimsuit and did not used it at all because it was so far from the room, and one has to pass by, without exaggeration, the middle of everything to get to it. Other than that, everything was perfect! 
plus^the room was very comfortable, the facilities were great the philly cheese steak in the food court is amazing, my husband loved that you could smoke without having to hide in a corner, the staff were amazing
minus^I didn't like that we had to pay full resort fee when the pool was not open, no where in the room to have some cold water unless you paid inflated in room charges, we had a champagne reception in the room for family that got married and we were charged a dollar each to use champagne glasses, I used to go to Vegas in the 90s and now its all about charging you for every little extra its a shame because once you add in the resort fee and tax the hotels cover all the little extras but they still charge for everything not cool
plus^The location was great. The breakfast was also good with plenty of choices.
minus^I sent 4 emails for early check-in until someone to give me a reply. The rooms are not worth the money. No facilities, not very spacy, nothing special.I was honeymoon er and they hadn't prepare anything. I asked for a nice view, which I didn't get.
plus^Good customer service. 
minus^Do NOT get a standard room in the unrefurbished wing.I Had unknowingly booked a room that that was just too depressing for me to contemplate staying in (and I've stayed in some bad places in my time). So for another $20 a night, I upgraded to a room in the refurbished wing, which was at least twice the size, if not more, with proper windows (I.E., natural light and a view), a proper bathroom and all facilities - none of which had been available in the first room - to make it very much more comfortable all round. The difference for $20 was truly unbelievable. Just don't remove anything from the minibar that you don't intend to consume because within 30 seconds (literally) it will automatically be charged to your bill without your knowledge and then you have the hassle of seeking refunds after your departure, because there is only automatic checkout and so you don't get a bill at the time. Even though I'd ticked the checkout form for an e-mail copy of the bill, no copy had arrived 2 weeks later, so I had to write and ask for it. I found out the hard way about the minibar, as I didn't know about the automatic system and had removed mgm items so I could put my own water and some yogurt in there. Unsurprisingly in a place with 5,000 rooms, the ground floor is a total circus and some of the food and drink on offer in bog-standard places is way overpriced. 
plus^Even though the hotel has been open for quite a few decades, the whole place is very modern, our room was very large with a great view of the Las Vegas Strip. Clean and comfortable. Where else to stay in Vegas of not on a place loke this!? Definitely recommended
minus^The hotel is absolutely huge, so it takes a few minutes to get from one place to another. This is not a bad thing, but something to consider if you have mobility issues.
plus^Staff were excellent, very friendly and polite
minus^The noise around the rooms. The rooms aren't sound proofed very well.  The hotel is showing its age, modern hotels have soft close doors so you don't hear doors crashing shut, any noise on the landings are deadened.   You need to start spending money on the accommodation areas to bring it up to modern day standards
plus^When we were able to get into the restaurants the food was delicious, great customer service within the establishment, very clean.
minus^The smoking in the casino was very uncomfortable,  we couldn't get the room cool enough to sleep comfortably.  The line for Starbucks were ridiculously long,  and the same with the buffet line.
plus^Amazing. The hotel has the best night club I have ever been to!
minus^Very big hotel, sometimes it takes too long to walk from one part of the building to another.
plus^Typical large Casino-Hotel. A lot of services within complex. Very close to Strip, if you exit from the right doors :) Very clean and tidy.
minus^Often long queues to access the services. Door keys very unreliable. Vegas style price level. No noise isolation between the rooms.
plus^The beds were comfy, staff was very nice, and liked the location of the hotel.
minus^I got put in the West Wing which is awful compared to their other towers. Old rooms that were very outdated. The sheets and pillowcases had some stains on them, the room smelled musty, there was mildew from where the water in the shower would overflow onto the tile EVERY time as the shower was not designed properly. The glass door to the bathroom was large and heavy to slide back and forth. There was no coffee maker in the room?! (Have never stayed in a hotel that didn't have a coffee maker before?!)  I've stayed in the other towers before and had a much more enjoyable time. I don't think I'll return here though after this experience!
plus^Staff ultra friendly
minus^Shower had mold , elevators broken all weekend , marathon weekend and fitness center had 5 of fifteen treadmills broken , no one paying attention .  Sink would not drain asked for it to be fixed no one ever came . Just very disappointed .
minus^On the mirror above lavatory, I have a big suspension of a hidden camera which is installed on a blackened shade of the mirror, room 556-10th floor. I cracked-open the mirror frame side and I can see there are communication and audio/video cables connected to a module panel on the blackened part of the mirror. I have a strong doubt that me and my wife's privacy were infiltrated. What is the purpose of those wires and why the mirror was blackened making it 2-way? Hotel management has to explain this to its costumer to avoid doubt.
plus^I want to brag on Steven at the grand buffet bar. He was so nice and made us laugh the two mornings we had breakfast.  He really helped to brighten our day. My friend and I had a wonderful time.   The beds were very comfortable and the rooms are ample size.
minus^When checking out of my hotel this morning I'm pretty sure a male prostitute tried to con me as i was walking down the corridor to the elevators.   It was a very disturbing encounter.
plus^Location
minus^They downgraded our room from a deluxe tower room to a standard room way over in the west wing. This was a very crappy part of the hotel. There was black mold on the walls, peeling paint, very low rent. We had prepaid 4 months ahead and they said We have to downgrade your room due to unforeseen circumstances.  There were still rooms available online but prices were jacked up because the presidential debate was there that night. I guess the chance to move out prepaid customers and get more money was unforeseen. It was so bad we checked out 15 hours later & flew home a day early.
plus^Fair hotel , with good location on the strip . Bit expensive with drinks & restaurants ,over priced in my opinion , compared to other hotels on strip .
minus^No coffee or tea facilities in the room.
minus^I paid $600 for a deluxe suite, only to be told at early check-in that no such room was available.  I've stayed in Las Vegas many times, and will never again stay at MGM Grand.
minus^My Reservation was not what I reserve I reserve 1 king bed for myself and my friend when we got there they gave us a 2 queen bed which made the room crowded when I check in they didn't tell me that it was 2 queen bed till I got to the room. (smh) they didn't change it we stay there for the one night we where their.The hotel blame it on a third party don't no if I be using the service again wasn't a good view of the city at all.
minus^At breakfast at the Avenue Café and had to walk all around the casino to find the closest bathroom. It does not make sense to offer food and no bathrooms.
plus^The facilities and service - when looking for things to do and see in the area for us last-minute types :-)
minus^knowing in advance that they take $400 from your account before you even step in your room for insurance. If you don't have it what happens then???  You get it back as long as you use no room service, mini bar or damage anything.  But it should be made clear before you book not when you arrive!!!
plus^It was convenient to where I needed to go for a friends wedding.
minus^The room was dirty and the hotel staff did nothing to remedy it. There was the smell of pot smoke coming through the ventilation at one point and the hotel is very noisy. Again, any concerns we had seemed more placated than any action being taken.
plus^Location only.
minus^The worst experience I’ve ever had. 1.	Don’t worth it’s money. Even room in motel would be much better. 2.	When you enter in the room, you get into the bath room/place where are sink with TV in a mirror which doesn’t work and two glass doors, one to the toilet and second to the shower. 3.	Conditioner is in night table. It means if you want to be warm you need to listen it whole night near your head. You can’t store anything in the night tables, there no any shuffles. 4.	A lot of towels but some of them pretty old and damaged, no slippers or bathrobe. 5.	Strange configuration of a safe, you can’t put there anything long like laptop only small book and horizontal. 6.	Did you see the oldest dust of Las Vegas, look at place where they store their TV equipment. 7.	Floor at the shower is ugly, there no even rubber mat. Used my wife’s slippers to be safe. 8.	The biggest and first disappointment was find someone's nail in the drawer. 9.	Mattress is pretty hard, looks like 10-15 years old. 10.	Toilet glass door didn’t fixed and could be damaged if you close it fast. We asked to fix it twice but no one ever showed up. 11.	Sink in a “bath-place“ is tightly clogged. Water is gone in 3-5 mins only.
minus^The room was at the end of a very long corridor and it was very old, there was no actual window or balcony, just a very small window behind the bed that barely let the light in
plus^Room was clean and nice.
minus^The MGM hotels switch to extra charging for parking was a huge turnoff, especially for paying guests.  I won't be staying at their hotels anymore.   Blinds didn't work so I couldn't shut out the night lights..  WIFI didn't work.   My view was of roof air conditioners.
plus^Very comfortable bed and clean room. We were very happy with our stay.
minus^We were able to stay at the MGM GRAND HOTEL! That was just awesome and beautiful!
plus^Comfortable bedding and pillows
minus^Free parking!!! These big casinos are GREEDY, it's not enough that you patronize them, gamble and dine at their properties ~ but you have to fleece the customer for parking as well??
minus^When we checked in we're given a room already occupied! That wasn't fun walking in on another couple. Got an upgrade for the mixup, keys to the room didn't work, had to change them 3 times! Vegas is fun, only need a few days there as after a while the smoking can get to you. Why on earth they haven't gone smoke free yet is cray!!!
plus^Tram is there for easy transport to other hotels and events! Suviner store out the back door for personal items and cheap beer! Nearby restaurantsports open 24 hours with reasonable prices 😆
minus^22 dollars for a beer? Surprised by 400 dollar hold on my credit card? Thought when I booked my credit card was charged. Upon arrival had to pay over 1000 for our room. Didn't plan on that expense. Resort charges. Lot of hidden fees.
plus^Room size good, large casino, good deli for breakfast and lunch. Efficient check in and check out
minus^Expensive restaurants and bars. Too far south on strip
plus^Close to Las Vegas Strip
minus^Dirty room found bugs in bathroom, dirty and spotted  dirty torned carpet, bad odors, can listing  people next room/hall way
plus^The location was really good, everything you could ever imagine was at the hotel and the concierge were really helpful at arranging tickets, tours etc.
minus^The hotel was actually really dirty which surprised me for such a big beautiful hotel.  People would leave used room service trays outside their rooms and it would take 2 days for them to be collected.  There was also a lot of rubbish in the elevator which I have never seen in my life in a hotel especially not from a hotel of this standard.
minus^Upon check in we mentioned that we were visiting Las Vegas to plan a wedding next July and the reception team member upgraded our room, I believe his name was Wesley, he was fantastic and very helpful. Whilst leaving the bedroom and returning to my room, every single member of the housekeeping staff that I came into contact with always said hello and how are you. They were always polite, courteous and happy. Pool staff very helpful and polite.
minus^The room we got,  Floor 22 room 309, was so unrestful. Got in at 1:30am and the green light that shines on the building from the outside just glared in our room all night. We were really tired from our long day of flying. No black out curtains. Really annoying. And then come 6:00 in the morning the sun is glaring so bright into that room. They've seriously gotta fix this. I could not sleep. Really disappointed for paying for a room to sleep in and I couldn't sleep at all. And pretty spendy too.
plus^The staff was very helpfull
minus^The cost from booking a room to end payment was diapointing as I have never paid for guest parking in any of the hotel I have stayed
plus^This hotel has a great location, wonderful pools and many many top-tier dining options to choose from. The room was remodeled and quite nice.
minus^I wish the walls were a bit thicker. Ultimately this didn't effect my nights sleep or my overall experience, but at times I could hear conversations in the hallway quite clearly as people walked by to their rooms.
plus^The bed was comfortable and was able to get some rest..
minus^The sheets were a lil dirty from the inside, we couldn't close the bathroom or the shower glass door. The glass that was connecting the bathroom and shower door was coming apart and it look like it was going to fall..
plus^Very busy and large hotel, good facilities and comfortable room and great value for the experience.
minus^It was a little daunting having to walk through the casino floor each time when accessing the hotel rooms.
plus^The account was not cooling. Rooms were to hot. You need to put something more on the doors so they bang all night.Food to expensive. No coffee pot. No refrigerator.
minus^Nice rooms
plus^The bed was comfortable
minus^We ordered a regular room and upgraded it to a king suite, the room was big but very old, not enough lighting, they put only one soap/shampoo at the bathroom and we were 2! The mini bar was half empty and used cans inside, probably they forgot to restock it, but the day after they just left the empty cans on top of the mini bar for display, not sure why. In the shower you can see mold on the wall. The only good thing in the room was the comfortable bed. Definitely not going to come back again. With the money i paid i could have stayed at a better hotel.
plus^The proximity to the event we were in town for was a plus!  There were many activities and restaurants under one roof.  The room was spacious and comfortable.  While there were a few things that would have made the stay more pleasant, all in all it was very enjoyable!  Check in and check out were a breeze!
minus^Trying to shower was a challenge.  The water vascillated between hot and cold; an even temperature could not be maintained.  A coffee pot in the room would have been desirable.  Also, having a wastepaper basket in the room (other than the bathroom) would have been helpful.
plus^Lots of things to do in hotel. Car parking was good and valet was excellent.  Great show at casino.
minus^Took a long time to get checked in and getting our room. Way too much smoke in casino for nonsmokers.
plus^Lots to do, exciting environment (tho I had to work). Checkout was very efficient, with a kiosk (no line at the time).  Bell service was convenient, with a wait of 0 mins and 10 mins.
minus^Checkin had a huge 50-min line all evening.
plus^Great location on the strip. The hotel has plenty of top class amenities. Great restaurants, food court, Starbucks, swimming pools, great gym. Its a huge place but the staff were great and we got treated well.
minus^If you wanted to go anywhere you had to walk through the casino gaming area where people where smoking which was very unpleasant as there really is no alternative. People where also smoking in the elevators and hall ways even though this was not permitted. The fridge in the room was full and if you took anything out to put your own water or drinks in, they charged you for whatever was taken out even if you didn't use it.
plus^Everithing was good but they give the word view rooms to the booking on line rooms.. it's the third time that this happened to us😞😒
minus^The rooms location and room view or should I say no view just a big wall
plus^Location was great & the room was fine ...
minus^The whole place constantly stunk of cigarettes as smoking was allowed almost everywhere .   Prostitutes were in abundance !   Drunks were loud and plentiful  .. shame.. as at one time  The MGM Grand must've been a beautiful hotel but now it's not nice at all..          it needs knocking down it's old and from what I saw in other hotels now a very poor relation !
plus^The room was spacious and was decorated well. The hotel and casino seemed clean and didn't smell like an ashtray, that's always nice. And the staff was friendly. Not always helpfulooking, as I did have a problem go unresolved, but friendly nonetheless.
minus^I rented a spa room for this trip. I do photography and knew I would be sore and wouldn't want to go to the public hot tub. So after a long day of shooting, I was really looking forward to the tub. Filled it up, turned on the Jets, and stepped in. Unfortunately tho, one of the Jets had come off. I stepped on it, losing balance and hurting the heel of my left foot. I called the desk and explained to them of what happened and they didn't offer much. Would you like an engineer to come repair the spa? Nope, I already repaired it myself. That was it. So I paid for something I didn't use/get. Other than that, the hotel was great.
plus^The hotel is in a good location to use the tram.The bed was comfortable,and the staff was friendly. The restaurants were great as well as the shows(KA).
minus^The shower in the room was horrible it was constantly clogged up and flooded out onto the bathroom floor,even after reporting it. And the TV could have had better movie channels like HBO and showtime. And the TV would randomly loose service as well as the WiFi.
plus^We were upgraded to a better room because the first room was dirty, had mildew in shower grout, sink didn't drain, so it would fill up very fast.. TV didn't work. Carpet was dirty, found food etc on floor up against the bed frame& wall.
minus^We were upgraded to a better room because the first room was dirty, had mildew in shower grout, sink didn't drain, & so it would fill up very fast.. The bathroom floor looked like someone spilled something & it was wiped but smeared on the floor still. TV didn't work. Carpet was dirty, found food etc on floor up against the bed frame& wall.  I wish I took pictures! The  person I spoke to , Karen, was rude. She said since we booked our room from a another party, she could move us to another room,  but we had gotten in at two in the morning, already had taken our showers and were exhausted.  She said if we wanted to upgrade to the room we would have to pay for it because of the way we booked a room.  She said also if we wanted to move rooms in the morning that we had to call and notify the front desk and be checked out by 11.  I called the front desk and was on hold with my cell phone and  the room phone for about 45 minutes.     When we finally got through we got moved to a very nice room however that night when we came back to our room tired.  The TV still did not work so for the entire stay that we were there we were never able to relax in bed and watch TV and that was so aggravating especially if this hotel was supposed to be a four or five star hotel.  We came to celebrate our anniversary of  36 years and we spent way too much time changing rooms and trying to get a hold of someone that would help us,  as well as having to go downstairs and stand in long lines to get room key changes and then having to go back down again to make sure we got credit on our account for a buffet and then having to go back down again to check out because the TV still did not work to check out and then having to talk to the front desk about a charge on our room that was not supposed to be charged.  It was ridiculous!!
plus^Location
minus^Very old and run down facility. Starting in the bathroom, the fan was broken. This means there was mold forming on the ceiling. Then, my toilet paper holder was broken, so the toilet paper would consistently fall onto the floor. Next, my shower curtain was filthy and orange, not to mention it was torn. Some of the towels were stained as well. The beds, although amazing, had stained pillow cases and sheets. Disgusting. After all that, the only elevator that seemed to go to my floor did not have lights turned on in it. On top of that, one of the lobby buttons was broken.  To finish, two broken escalators and the ice machine was broken on my floor.  Not worth the money, will not stay here again.
minus^The check-in lines were insanely long. Took well over an hour to check-in and we got there early. The folks who got there on time waited for several hours. The room we had had a banner over the exterior window, which obscured the view.
minus^Fridgerator was prestocked and if you drank a soda from it you had to pay a $50 restock fee You're just a number.. On busy night, room service was 1h 30min wait...
plus^Your facility could not accommodate the convention I felt- the halls were packed and long lines everywhere. Too many people.
minus^Too many people to squeeze in to conference center- really long lines everywhere.. even to eat lunch somewhere.
minus^It would have been great to have had a mini fridge in the room. The ice machine was out on many floors at once when we needed it and had to go without. The restaurants were also sub par and overpriced.
plus^Very generously sized and comfortable with room with good facilities - 2 large TVs for example. Room was efficiently serviced each day.
minus^Registering was a nightmare! Lobby was overflowing with people and confusion. Hotel was extremely busy at all times, and not one if you do not like crowds.
plus^Great location on the strip. Check in took a little while but express check out was fine.
minus^The long check in que and the way the staff at check in kept talking too much to make pointless small talk.
minus^To have a proper bathroom.didnt appreciate washing in the hall,bathroom door didn't shut and was see through.my daughter who is in a wheelchair,her showering facilities were ridiculous.dhower bench wasn't under the shower head.half the time there was no hot water and the bars were the opposite end.
plus^Good location for Strip, either walking or there's a Deuce/SDX bus stop right outside. Plenty of choice for food / drink. FedEx counter in lobby great for free printing of boarding passes etc, but watch out for 50c mark up on postage stamps!
minus^Lobby bar has 2-drink minimum, as if you hadn't already paid enough for the room / resort tax.... Very expensive for food and drink - but that's Vegas! No kettle / fridge / microwave in West Wing rooms - should take note of the much cheaper and well-equipped Best Western McCarran Inn, about 20 mins walk away... My sister upgraded to a pricier room with fridge/mini-bar, but anything removed (to put your own stuff in there) would be charged for! Smoking inside the hotel - yeuch!!  In this day and age, you Americans are so far behind in some ways ;)
plus^When we arrived there was a long queue for check in but this was managed well and we got through in no time. Plus they were able to give us our room straight away and we did not have to wait for it to be cleaned.  There is a buffet for breakfast, dinner & lunch. We only used it for breakfast & lunch, good selection of food & costs approximately $20 per person.
minus^Just be aware that the cost given by booking.com is not the final total. There is a resort fee and hotel tax per night which will be added to your bill at reception. Can be a surprise if you are not expecting it & if you stay for a few nights.
plus^Relatively good location on the edge of the street seller and there is also a separate pool parties in the complex which is located in the hotel (extra charge). Nice rooms, great casino, excellent staff.
minus^Need to deposit $ 400 (credit card) guarantee for each room that abnormal amount.
plus^Bed and pillows were comfortable and a nice smart TV.
minus^Shower overflowed into whole bathroom. Then there was no hot water for 3 days. Bathroom sink looked poorly made. Very small counter space in bathroom. Closet was too low so dresses dragged on floor. Interior of closet was well worn.
plus^Our overall experience was disappointing. From the check in we had the wait in a long line, then our toilet didn't work properly and then when we moved room our shower was cold. The manager Woody did give us compensation and was very good but MGM was disappointing for a 4 star hotel and I wouldn't stay again.
minus^Room facilities
minus^Our stay here was fab, the room was really big and clean. I was especially impressed with the housekeeping service tidying round after we left it in a bit of a mess! Good location to access the strip, lots of facilities onsite including a huge pool/outside area.
plus^Great location, great bars . Great restaurants ,  nite club and pools, u could spend 2 weeks in Vegas and never need to leave the hotel
minus^Having to leave
plus^Electrical outlets, bed, pillows
minus^I asked specifically for rooms to be next to each other, did not get it. MGM is now part of group of hotels that charge for parking
plus^Location to the airport was ideal, the monorail comes right to the hotel & many attractions are walking distance if you like a nice stroll. The room size, bedding and room amenities are comfortable and relaxing.
minus^It was about a 30-35 minute wait to check in on Saturday morning. It was quite crowded in the pool & casino areas but then again, we were all there for a fun time!
plus^MGM is the Mecca of Vegas...it's a great meeting spot and has everything in one great location. Still the best place to be in Vegas if you ask me!
minus^The pool closes entirely too early for the fall season. It's still extremely hot in Vegas in Sept/October. Kicking guests out the pool at the prime evening hour of 5pm is crazy...especially considering how large the pool complex is. Kind of a waste. I kinda felt like we were corralled off like children. I'd love to do promotions/marketing specifically in that area...(shameless plug...HIRE ME!) Also, it may be time for a little guest room remodeling. For the caliber of their guests, the interior guest room's decor doesn't match their swag. IMO, it doesn't match the opulence of the lobby, casino, club/restaurants, event space areas. MGM is still my old faithful...I always enjoy myself!
plus^Nothing
minus^They screwed up booking . Locked me out of my room security took 1.5 hours to meet me there. Then security busted in in middle of the night due to water leak. Then after seeing it was safe told them no on housekeeper at 3am she busted in anyway. Had a 6 am flight did not sleep a wink .  Manager rude and should be fired! Worst experience ever
plus^The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful, and the location made it very easy to get around. 
minus^The hotel rooms are quite dated. The first room we got was so dusty, my friend kept on sneezing...this is after they convinced us to pay extra for a room upgrade! They let us switch to another room on their stay well floor (some kind of allergy free room) which was a slight improvement but I wouldn't recommend this hotel.
plus^Good rooms, got an upgrade when we checked in. Great location and huge buffet selection.
minus^Food was higher priced than others, eat out unless you have to stay in.
plus^Good location. Pool area was good too.
minus^Poor quality for the amount of money we paid. The rooms were quite dirty and the towels weren't clean. It is fine but just rather outdated. Staff were useless - they didn't have a clue about anything we asked them - for example what time the pool was open!
plus^Grand it is! that's the biggest hotel and located very conviniently
minus^You can't escape the smell of cigarettes smoke in the casino and in the room - it's pretty bad
plus^Clean rooms, large restaurant selection.
minus^Parking too far. Easy to get lost and make wrong turn. Casino not ventilated enough from cigarette smoke. Nothing for children to do. Mini bar sensor falsely triggerred by moving the items and had to wait 15 mins on line at checkout to correct invoice.
plus^Joel rubuchon was an amazing dining experience. The pools were awesome. It was all very clean. We upgraded to a suite and it was amazing.
minus^They charged my friends British MasterCard twice at check out by mistake. Although they refunded the second total straight away they were non too apologetic about the fact that it meant $699 would be pending and not back in his account for 5 days. Leaving him with no money for the rest of the trip. He asked them about this and they just said. Our system is faulty it does this with mastercards all the time, don't worry your money will come back to your account next week - not really the point. Tip...don't pay with a MasterCard here! When I was asked if I wanted to upgrade at check in they didn't Include added tax and resort fee to the amount meaning it was A LOT more than we thought it would be.
plus^The bed was comfortable and the view of the small portion of the strip was good.
minus^The strong odor in the bathroom coming from the sink drain.  We did call for a hotel tech to come and look at it and he put chemical down the drain.  That helped for only a couple of hours.  Water pressure in the shower was poor.
plus^Everything was perfect! I was celebrating my 30th whilst staying here and when we got to the room they had laid out cupcakes and a birthday card. We also got engaged and they arranged everything with my boyfriend to surprise me, the whole stay from start to finish was perfect. Super clean room, amazingly helpful and friendly staff and ideal location at the start of the Vegas strip.
minus^Everything was perfect!
plus^Fiamma Trattoria had excellent service and delicious food
minus^West Wing - very cramped rooms Poorly maintained Decor is dated and tired Parking is not free for guests
plus^Overall stay was good MGM is close to everything excellent location.
minus^Absolutely no view from the room, WiFi was not working for me, no water was provided in the room nor any coffee making machine. Touch expensive but I guess it's Vegas.
plus^They waived the resort fee at check-out
minus^Tiny rooms in West Wing Asked for an upgrade, but the front desk told us the hotel was completely full. Called on the phone and got the upgrade.  Bad plumbing in both rooms No hot water No free parking Refrigerator was useless, no room for beverages or snacks purchased elsewhere. No coffee maker in ANY rooms Badly in need of renovation
plus^Center of strip location for meeting friends
minus^$10 just to park the car ,high resort fee (what is that about ) no coffee facilities in the room so long que at starbucks in the morning !another $10 mercenry hotel
plus^Great staff. Lots of things to do on the property. Including a Circue show. Good Location as well.
minus^No kettle in the room to even make a cup of tea. So forget about complementary tea coffee or even water! Which for the 200 dollars a night that we paid seems like not a lot to ask for! And they charge extra to unlock the fridge.
plus^I always stay at the MGM when we go to Las Vegas. I like the layout of the Casino, I feel comfortable their. I like the atmosphere of the MGM better. I like everything about the MGM.
minus^I had to leave.
plus^We really enjoyed our stay at the MGM,, our first visit to Vegas. Clean spacious standard double bedroom, great pool area and friendly staff. In general the hotel was a little tired but clean.
minus^We waited 45 minutes to check in on arrival which was a little frustrating.
plus^Nothing good about it, complete rip off. I'm surprised that they don't have pay toilets in the suitese
minus^Everything about the place was a disappointment
plus^Brilliant Location, made it easy to drive to and get around the strip, super facilities, the entertainment was very good, rooms were quiet and well sized
minus^Really dislike smoking in public areas, some other hotels managed to control the fumes better. Reception was a little chaotic, Paying to park was a little petty considering we were residents
plus^The show KA was great and room services was great.
minus^The room was very dirty and the carpet was nasty. I book by room back in May with 3 other family couples. I had upgraded my room and when I arrived for check in I got the same room as the other couples and they pay less. We all book our rooms the same day and time.  I called the MGM and they were very rude to me and would not help me. All I was asking to reimburse me for the difference.
plus^the location was very good, its proximity to the airport was good.  The rooms were spacious and guiet.
minus^The hotel, compared with a lot of other hotels we have stayed in worldwide, was expensive, considering we regarded the decor as worn and tired.  All other hotels provide a coffee maker at least. Or at least access to refreshments nearby.    As we had arrived from a long-haul flight, we did not use the hotel to gamble and were only using the hotel overnight, we felt that the extra charge was unfair and expensive. it does not encourage us to re-visit.  When checking in and checking out, we encountered very long queues, this is not something we have ever encountered  before.in any hotel.
plus^Good location. Easy to visit other hotels and attractions. The staff was friendly and helpful.
minus^We stayed in the west wing. If you enjoyed the Shining, you will appreciate the hallway. The carpet was dirty and there was little counter space in the bathroom. Too little space for 2 people. Will not stay here again. Can get a better value at a better hotel.
plus^Nice location, relatively cheap, and quite new furniture.
minus^Check-in took two hours(!!) with a line the same length as an airport check-in. I assume that due to the relatively low price and the location of the hotel on the strip the hotel was full of douchebags, people were drunk and loud in the hotel. They offered us to upgrade the room for $20 more per night, even though it was a more prestigious room with a king bed and a strip view, the room was very dusty, the shower didn't have cold water so it was either boiling or no shower at all (they sent an engineer to fix it but by that time we had to go to a show). The hotel has insane prices on everything that is not included in the room. The credit for food and beverage can only be used in about 5-6 places in the hotel (the MGM buffet costs $30 +tax per person!!).
plus^看秀方便 价格比较优惠
minus^When i checked been told somebody already checked for me and make me waiting .20min.AND IT IS NOT FINISH，when i back room found the room key not work and other body got my room for double checked in.！！！Termanagement ！！！Make me check in again and without an appologize！！
plus^Room was very comfortable and quiet.  Blackout shade was a plus.  Check in and check out was very smooth.
minus^Too expensive.  Dealers were not very friendly at the blackjack tables.  Buffet was a ripoff at $32 for breakfast.  Very difficult to get a reservation at a restaurant.  Overall felt too crowded.  Added name to room so my roommate could order food and drink around the resort, but that didn't work.
plus^The main floor smells of smoke and this was not the case with other Casino/hotels. This place nickles and dimes you for everything. Terrible value for dollar.
minus^The wait at checkin was reticuluos at bag check/claim too long. We bought a bar of chocolate at MGM grand, placed it in refrigerator in room then were directed not to use the refrigerator for penalty of a restocking fee... as if I hadn't already paid 4 times what this was worth. Buffet was average for the price.
minus^The room we booked was clean, and when I notified the staff they made me stand back in line for a new room, but I did get and upgrade and $50.00 for food or drink which I didn't use not for room service
plus^Comfortable clean room. Plenty of different restaurants. Several pools to choose from. Helpful staff. Huge casino.
minus^Would have liked tea and coffee making facilities in the room. Otherwise loved it.
plus^Good location , comfy beds and great casino
minus^They want to charge for everything !! Even to put medication ( insulin) inside the room fridge , prostitutes everywhere , even had one knock on our door at 5.30 in the morning with her customer claiming to have been attacked by him, which I did report  , no security anywhere other than the casinos.
plus^Location in the heart of las Vegas city Resort area facilities 
minus^A lot of hidden fees that you need to take care about. The rooms design are a bit aged. 
minus^2 am we were looking for food . Asked security. They said only subway was open. The next day we found out there were a couple of restaurants open till 6 am.. Security should know more of what is available, at different times.
plus^Comfortable beds, beautiful casino, lots of entertainment, our quiet room. Everything was super clean in the Hotel and all of Vegas.  Shuttles, buses and trams  were great and we never felt unsafe.
minus^some of the food is pricey
plus^Quite during sleep time. Staff awesome. Educational conference area -  didn't know it was attached to the Hotel. Google maps sent us outside and around to the back entrance. Should have asked front desk. Very nice room .
minus^We checked in our bags at the bell desk for the day after we checked out but when we picked it up it took too long.  Plus the fridge did not close and nothing was cold in our room.
plus^Pool area was good. Great overall position.
minus^A little dated in places. Our room was very dark with litttle natural light..... but we weren't in it much!
plus^The bed was very comfortable, casinos was good.
minus^First up no coffee and tea facilities in the room, next bathrooms had a lot of hair left in them which wasn't ours. Drainage in bathroom very poor.  Drinks in casino where very hard to get, you spend way much more gambing waiting for a drink better to go to the bar. Prices in Vegas are very expensive $10 a beer.
minus^I did not really appreciate that I had to pay separate resort fees for the Wifi (and the fitness center I did not use...) or the overnight parking space. I would expect this to be included in the price advertised.  There was shampoo only for one person although the room was booked for three adults.   We also found very annoying there was no space in the mini fridge to put our own bottles of water.
minus^too big. Not all pools were open due to off season so the pools that were open, so busy and hard to get  chairs. Too smokey as walking thru to get to restaurants
plus^I loved the total atmosphere of the MGM. The music in the lobby bar the spacing out of yr machines. I liked the online checkout system on the tv and the movies.
minus^I didn't like that my room key didn't work and I had to return to the front desk three times. My room was on the 12th floor and 36 units down the hall. To walk back amd the key doesn't open door that sucks.
plus^I liked the location.it was easy to visit other hotel properties.
minus^The. Rooms could have had a little more amenities like a refrigerator and microwave. They charged you every little thing when some things should have been complimentary like water and chips.
plus^The buffet in the hotel was very good. The hotel is on the strip. The room was nice.
minus^No view from our window. Just the view of a building in front of us.
plus^Plenty of space in the room. Clean and fresh, bed very comfy.  Managed a dip in the pool. Staff were really helpful when we asked for directions, as the hotel is very large and we did get lost a few times.
minus^There where no coffee facilities in the room. Would have loved a coffee to start the day without getting dressed and going for breakfast
plus^Great location,facilities and room.Staff were great as usual. What a great holiday!
minus^Closing of the Lazy River during the week. Made the other pools very crowded.
plus^The bed was very comfortable. The view from our 13th floor window as pretty at night. The shower was of a nice size.
minus^The setup of the restroom facilities were awkward in my opinion. There was very little space to work with around the sink/mirror area.
plus^Position was great.
minus^Waited for 20 minutes in a que for breakfast only to be told our vouchers were not enough and that we needed ID which was on the 24th floor.  Back to the que after collecting ID to wait another 30 minutes to get a table. 20 minute wait on phone for their express check out then hung up.  Tried to do checkout on the tv as was suggested in hotel guide only to find previous guests bill was still showing as being unpaid so we could not use that either.   So sick of waiting. Went downstairs to self checkout.....which showed us owing for our free breakfast...spent another 25 minutes in another que to get this error corrected.  Terrible terrible customer service.
minus^First night we had a safety issue in the bathroom the curtain rod was just about to fall off and unsecured to the wall we could not shower for seven and a half hours it was finally fixed at 2:15 in the morning A.M not a happy camper and also the pool just too far away to enjoy The Lazy River was closed only for the people that we're at the hotel Friday Saturdays other than that it was it was closed not good for business for people who come into the hotel Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday
plus^As the name says...MGM Grand was GRAND!  Beautiful throughout. Staff from Valet Parking to Check-in staff, to porters, to restaurant personnel were ALL very friendly and informative.  We did not take advantage of everything the MGM had to offer because of limited time and other commitments, but we loved every minute of our time there.  Don't discount the buffet as a place to get a great meal. We ate one breakfast and one dinner there...great value for the cost with an incredible selection of food options.  Something for Everyone!
minus^This place was superb across the board!
plus^The pool area is fantastic
minus^We were downgraded a room which we found out when we arrived - this was not the room we paid for and was an inconvenience having to move rooms after 1 night
plus^The check in staff (lady) was very kind to give us a free upgrade to stay in a suite instead of giving us 2 standard room.  The suite was superb, good view and luxury.  Thank you and we appreciate your generosity MGM Grand.
minus^Smoking in the casino.
minus^The room was run down...towels either stained or had holes in them. There should be a small refridgerator that you don't have to pay for. Bathroom clean but old/well used.
plus^concert venue was excellent, front desk was awesome and friendly, everytime we had a question it was always answered in a friendly professional manner
minus^the parking maybe a little closer? Its okay the walk was good for us
plus^nice friendly people -clean - close to a lot
minus^,tv working-shower pressure-pool 9to5 huh - resort fee first day check in 3 pool only open till 5 charging fee for no use -resort fee should bee 1/2 first day --get right food order
plus^nice room
minus^the hotel have diducted the full night two months before my arrival, this was a deal which I could cancell a day before my arival. Then, on the night preice of 65 $ they wanted to charge my account for 108$, telling me that 38$ is booking the room for me!!!!!
plus^Didn't have a refrigerator that I can stored my drinks. Didn't like them mini refrigerator that had drinks you have to pay for. I rather have an empty fridge.
minus^I didn't like the check line, too slow. Always mess up my bill. I was suppose to have complimentary  buffet meals each stay that was included the booking.com but I got charged for it and had to call in and fix it knowing I warned the front desk before I check in that I told them make sure it states complimentary.
plus^Very comfy bed. Great pool area. So close to everything with a lively buzz.
minus^West wing rooms dont have big windows. Bathroom set up is weird and resort fees etc added an extra 400 on to bill plus another 200 deposit.
plus^Massive hotel  Great reception staff Good location on strip Everything you need there
minus^Very expensive drinks  Looking slightly dated now Bathrooms are open plan Pool is seasonal- disappointed
plus^Location on the Strip was nice...Casino and Taps Sports bar were excellent.
minus^We were located in the West Wing, next stay we'd like to stay in a different part of the hotel.
plus^Pools and location
minus^Smelled like smoke and had construction noise early in the morning (5am!). Bars too expensive, prices not even disclosed. Still have not received final bill per email after one week.
plus^Comfortable bed, clean, ideal location
minus^Our sink was blocked upon arrival and it took 4 phonecalls to get it fixed. We paid upon arrival and upon checkout were told that we had been undercharged by $9 and this had to be charged. WiFi was poor and dropped signal. There was a fridge in the room but we would have to pay $25 per night to use it.
plus^the staff was friendly and helpful ,the resorts is nice and has a lot to offer ,pool area was very nice
minus^the room wasn't what we booked and saw in the pictures when we went to he website ,we had to change rooms because the first one was dirty .
minus^Food by the pool very poor considering $20 for a wrap! There was a convention on when we stayed, 17,000 people attended, all staying in the hotel, which meant all the pools were closed bar one, we had to que for lifts to our room, bars, taxis, Casino tables, and even to walk down stairs! Was mayhem and the hotel seemed to struggle to accommodate them all...
minus^Was holding a large conference so huge queues at check out and breakfast lines - it's a great hotel but I wouldn't recommend booking it if there's a conference on.... manic.
plus^There was a lovely welcome greeting on the tv in our room when we arrived. The decor was impressive. The staff were very friendly and helpful.
minus^Food was very expensive in general, along with coffee. Apart from that everything was great.
plus^Room was comfortable and spotless. Loved the KA Cirque du Soleil performance.  The concierge service providers were excellent. Check out process was easy and painless.
minus^Need to improve check-in procedure.  WAY too long, though the fellow who checked me in, Moises, was very nice and helpful. Cost of food and alcohol was ridiculous..
plus^The room was lovely and the staff were very friendly.
minus^We were locked out of our room for half of the day and ended up having to go to a show and clubs in clothes we had worn all day.
plus^The size of the suite was great although the could do with better lighting.
minus^The staff in the casino, could get around to the players more. Waited a good 20mins for someone to assist me after pressing the service button and she only stopped for me when I approached her, as the machine had stopped working and I still had money in it. The waiting time for checking in is ridiculous, we were in line for 1hour, although luckily we had already given our bags to the holding luggage area, so we didn't have to line up for that again. The buffet let us buy tickets for dinner, but then we had to wait again for 30mins before they had a table for us, had we known that, we would have dined somewhere else. We also stayed at the Venetian and the amount of people checking in (at the same time as us was at an estimate) the same although the wait time was less than ten minutes & were much better organised to handle large crowds.
plus^A fabulous place to stay in Vegas! Perfect location, just at the beginning of the Strip. Comfortable rooms, with a very good standard. Worth adding a little more for the resort view.
minus^no cons to this opinion
minus^Wifi connection is bad. Had a cold shower (no warm water). I chose this hotel for the pool, and half of the pool area was closed, my son was very disappointed.
plus^Convenient and easy to find. Multiple facilities and really good rate for weekdays . Attentive staff who goes extra mile to help 
minus^Disappointing wifi at lobby and common area. Took forever to get connected. Staff has no clue where to get a SIM card for traveller. Buffet standard is not matching its hotel quality. 
minus^The rooms were very outdated for the price I paid for the room. I have paid nearly the same at other hotels in Las Vegas and they were much nicer. I even got a free upgrade at this hotel and my upgraded room was still not that impressive. A little disappointed to say the least.
plus^Good price and fair deal. The club Hakkasan is great and it had a great pool party/pool area.
minus^Rooms are a little dated. The shower was poor flow. The casino area on the weekend is full of.. Well let's just say the weird and wonderful.
plus^The location was great. The room is big and the bed is comfortable.
minus^The carpet in our room was dirty. Breadcrumbs scattered on the floor. Not enough lighting in the room too.
minus^To get to the room , you walked down a very  long dark corridor . The rooms were off the corridor like storage units . There was one elevator at the end of the corridor . Once upstairs ,you had to walk all the way back. The bathroom was right at the door . There was no door to the bathroom. . When you got out of the shower you were standing in front of your outside door. The room was dark, with a small window which looked out at a wall. The room was chrome filled, cold, uninviting, dull lights.
plus^Location
minus^Smoke smell everywhere in the casino and the restaurants.....and paper thin walls....could hear the next room having sex....lots of drunk people there, Walmart crowd
plus^Location was good
minus^The television didn't work properly, it kept loosing reception. Also, the television in the bathroom mirror was cool but only had 2 channels, which was lame. The staff left people's food sitting in the hallway all day long. There is nothing like passing someone else's breakfast scraps 5 times throughout the day.
plus^The staff were lovely and friendly, they upgraded our room as it was my 40th birthday. The hotel room was lovely and clean and the location was excellent.
minus^Nothing I didn't like.
plus^Not much!!  Jonathan, Jane (front desk) & Monique (lobby) went out of their way to help!
minus^Room dirty. No water first day, no hot water in shower, spent one day just moving rooms (had 3), no A/C..  need me to continue - I have lots more!!  2.9 rating is higher than it should be!
plus^Good location, staff all pleasent
minus^The tobacco smell in the casino area's (in fairness it was like this in most of the casino's. It should have more no smoking area's (it is 2016, not the 1970's). Also the amount of extra money you get charged in resort fee's , tax's etc adds a fortune to your bill so make sure your prepared for them....
plus^Hotel room view.. Hakkasan night club.  The breakfast buffet although a bit pricey for breakfast. -
minus^Smoke smell throughout the hotel. No coffee maker in rooms.
plus^When I checked into the hotel my room provided was unclean. I was immediately taken care of by the staff who also upgraded my stay. very professional and apologetic.
minus^Dirty room upon arrival
plus^Location. Options in casino.
minus^We were told we would not like our standard room and was advised to upgrade for a prime strip view. We were VERY disappointed with the view. It was described as the best view, I beg the differ. Would not want to see a bad  view. Feeling like I was mislead by the information provided and it cost me an extra $35/night for this prime strip view
plus^Good quality for price. Very close to the airport. Excellent staff and not run-down hotel as other casino hotels in the area. Excellent resort hotel.
minus^Nothing
minus^Don't waste your money on the cheaper rooms. They are very basic, no tea/coffee in the room, no outside view (felt like i'm staying in a basement). You will be better off staying somewhere else. Do your research and don't go for the brand name.
plus^Location, room, facilities and service were brilliant!
minus^Check in was a bit longer than I would have liked due to queue. Not used to smoking within the facility so did not spend a lot of time on the casino floor. Quick checkout in room does not allow for credits back to your account.
plus^A great stay at the MGM for our first trip to Vegas! Check-in was a breeze and we were in the room in about 15 minutes. We stayed in a Tower Suite and had no complaints at all about the room - big comfortable bed, great spa tub, charging points all around the room and a stocked mini bar. The casino was lively and the drinks service good. Ate at the buffet one night, food was good and varied but I don't know what other buffets are like over there! Bars at the pool were great, I'd recommend a refillable cup if you plan on staying a while there for better value.
minus^The only downside to the stay was that the pool closed very early every day. While I understand that we're out of season, the pool was very busy and to be kicked out at 5pm was a bit of a let down, the lazy river was also closed until Friday and we were checking out on Saturday.
plus^The bed was amazing and the room was good and clean
minus^Wasn't enough privacy when you were at the toilet because it was a glass door and you could hear everything. The cleaning staff opened the door around 9 to clean and we were asleep. After that we were always alert when we heard any noise outside our room
plus^Starbucks
minus^I was in the old section . West wing ... the hall carpets are stained and musty.  The walls are very plain you could tell I went from I like luxurious casino into a dumpy room .  You could hear people through the walls so it was hard to sleep . Very thin walls.   Didn't get much sleep on Friday night at all . Casino payouts are terrible. I will never stay here again.  I have it stayed in about 15 different resorts in Vegas and this was the worst experience .
plus^I liked the layout of the room and it was very clean. The staff was so helpful in making reservations for the show and restaurant. Checkin and checkout was very smooth. Liked that we could keep one of our room keys after checkout so we could get our car out of the garage without additional cost.
minus^Smoking in the casino was bothersome especially when people don't care where they blow their smoke and it smells bad.  Distance from the elevator to our room was very long. Price of breakfast selections was excessive.
plus^Nothing
minus^Over an hour from check in line to room. Many counters but only 6 open. Put us in a handicap room and the shower flooded the entire bathroom and entry hall. shower curtain stopped about 10 from the floor and wheel chair accessible floor lip could not keep water in stall. We were not handicapped! room was over 100 rooms from elevator- in case of fire, we would have been dead. Fancy motorized curtains and drapes did not work. Worst hotel on our whole trip. Restaurants in hotel very over priced. We felt we were being gouged at every turn. All the escalators heading to NYNY, and Tropicana were broken on the outbound side. but all the incoming were working fine. Get you in but  wouldn't let you out!!
plus^The room was very comfortable and the staff wonderful. The hidden charges were not helpful! The food was good but expensive...18$ for a burger. It was good but did' by come with anything else
minus^18$hamburger didn't come with anything.short but reasonably sweet.
plus^The 14th floor Stay Well was very good with a good view over LV. The whole MGM is on a very high level and there was not a wish that couldn't be fulfilled! The pool party wet republic was such an awesome experience had so much fun. The Hakkasan is also a Club you should visit - not just because it's voted to be the In-Club in Vegas. Just little bit more room for non-VIP would be fine to get a better atmosphere there.
minus^The personal serving that drinks @the pools was not very friendly or even looking for us. Then the girl just forgot our drinks btw. she told me that it wasn't possible to book it to my room. It was her mistake because she did it for the wrong name with the wrong room number. So if you want to enjoy a drink @pool get it yourself at one of the bars to prevent maybe a waiting time or you would be forgotten.
plus^Enjoyed the comedy show and KA. Won money on the slots!
minus^The lazy river was the reason we booked this hotel and it was closed. The person at the front desk said it was closed for winterizing. In September when it's 90 degrees outside. The shower was DISGUSTING. THIS WAS THE NASTIEST shower I have ever seen in a hotel room. We stayed in the west wing and it's old dark and dirty. Yuck! 40 dollar hotel rooms in Europe were cleaner than this and we paid about 190 a night. We ate breakfast twice at the mgm and both times the food was lousy. We had very good dinners at Cesers Palace and the Yard House. I WOULD never stay at the MGM again but would definitely come back to vegas.
plus^Bed and room were clean and very comfortable! 
minus^The price! I could've stayed anywhere and I stayed at mgm for the proximity to the iHeart Radio concert. If I had known other hotels were closer and cheaper, I would've stayed elsewhere. 
plus^The bed was very comfortable and the water pressure was great.the personnel were all very friendly.
minus^There was alot of cigarette smoke as soon as I got off the elevator on the main floor. It made my clothes smell and I am not a smoker.
plus^The bed was large and roomy
minus^The dark, dingy, long hallways remind me of a prison. It was too far to walk to get to an elevator. No doors separating bedroom and bathroom causes lack of privacy. Room was so small and dark. No view. Noisy at night when trying to sleep. Lack of toilets when downstairs. Food places were too expensive. No frig in room, no coffee maker. No laundry facility. No choice to make a cup of tea. Too large and no help available when needed.
plus^A lot of amenities.
minus^Room had some issues. Bathroom toilet did not work. Air conditioning randomly would malfunction and turn off. I called customer service and no one came to fix it.
minus^The hotel is ridiculously large and as a result I found the experience very impersonal. The smoking environment throughout the hotel was disgusting. After a long flight we didn't appreciate the hour long queue to check in. Won't be returning there!.
plus^I really liked the comfortable bed and the shower.  I especially enjoyed the spa tub in the tower suite.  The view was great too! I also liked the swivel tv the room was very spacious!  Room and facilities were very clean upon arrival.
minus^Didn't like the long check in line-30 minute wait.  Also one day we called housekeeping for our room to be cleaned, they said they put us on the list and when we got back 4 hours later, it hadn't been cleaned yet. Had to call again, and no one knew why?? Someone came after I called a 3rd time.  We wanted our room cleaned once
plus^Variety of facilities. Location on the strip Atmosphere was exellent
minus^Some of the outlets were overpriced. Made us eat and drink outside the hotel as overpriced
plus^Great place. Had everything you needed and more. Would definitely go again.
minus^The hotel is huuuuge. So to walk to the pool area from our room took a long time. Queue for Starbucks was always too long.
plus^Room shape was great minus the open concept bathroom.
minus^Hallways feel like a jail cell.   Poor navigation.  Very dark and drab.   Made me feel like I should stay in the room or on the strip.  Poor elevator location.
plus^Property is located convenient to the Vegas strip & good casino area. Room was clean and updated, and staff was courteous and professional.
minus^Always a crap-shoot how a facility treats you on check-in when reservation booked through an outsourced booking service rather than hotel directly.  MGM is a fine property, which placed me into perhaps the lowest rated room for guest experience. Admittedly clean and updated, that said, small as a broom closet, no view of any Vegas lights and at the end of multiple long hallways.  As they say, you get what you pay for.
minus^I was charged for room beverages  when I did not open a single one ,luckily another staff member asked and caught the mistake . I was locked out of my room for hours I wasn't trying to pay 400+ dollars for no reason .. This will be the first and last time I will stay at mgm
plus^The location was great and the bed and pillows were very comfortable.
minus^It was easy to get lost inside of the hotel. The lighting in the room was bad and there was no place to hang a toiletry bag.
plus^Great rooms in the tower. But this is a huge resort hotel so I wouldn't go back.
minus^Do not book the West Wing - its like a motel! We booked a deluxe King - MGM doesn't have a deluxe King and the room description didn't match Booking.com description. MGM upgraded us to the Tower.. much better. This is a huge resort hotel you can wonder round it for hours and not see daylight. The Casino which is the whole of the ground floor is smokey and so is the pool area. Pool shuts at 5 too! Go elsewhere
plus^Room was comfortable and the swimming pools were good
minus^Drinks prices on the whole seemed to be very high at the MGM - we enjoyed our stay there but for what you pay I didn't think there was anything exceptional about this hotel in particular and would probably stay somewhere else next time.
plus^Location is great and if you want a holiday where you just pop into your room to crash for a few hours couldn't fault it.
minus^We paid £20 (a night) to have an upgrade, previously they just offered us one but we loved the room last time we didnt mind paying. Our room was basic, no hot drinks facilities which didn't sit well as I love a cuppa. Our door was ridiculously lose and when we put the air con on or someone walked down the corridor the door would shake and it sounded like someone was getting in this happened every night!! I also have a lactose intolerance and put some soy milk in the fridge (finding breakfast is always a stress on holiday) to which I got a direct note from house keeping say they would charge us to use it and took the milk out leaving me screwed for breakfast the next morning. On departure we complained, we have stayed twice before and enjoyed both times so it's not a 'thing' we do is find fault. They couldn't refund our upgrade but could refund a 'hotel fee' which was $33 a day!! Overall the stay was okay but not great!
plus^Great location and room 
minus^I paid extra for a grand tower spa suite as it was my wife's birthday. The spa jacuzzi did not work. Rang engineering and after 30 mins on hold. We gave up and our champagne was warm.  Complained upon check out and they did not care
minus^3rd visit to this hotel. Was given room in the west wing. Very disappointed with the quality of the room, very sub par in comparison to previous visits. Would not recommend a stay in the west wing.
plus^They were really helpful when I made a mistake and book a second room for the wrong day. They didn't have to but they wanted to help because of all the hassle booking.com gave me.
minus^I didn't like that it smelled so much like smoke. Though that's what happens in casinos
plus^The room was very spacious and comfortable. the hotel was within walking distance of everything
minus^Tried to use the express check out in the room but it didn't work
plus^Everything
minus^The people on the way to the pool that was handing out discount voucher. One person was really nasty. I went back 5 minutes later on my own without my children and she didn't talk to me in a nice manor. She just brushed me off. Extremely disappointing and nasty lady. Specially in front of my son.
plus^Very nice clean hotel in the right area if visiting vagas . But beware
minus^Well in England we have a little seaside town called Blackpool which is famous for hen and stage party's and young People drinking and been a little out of control with drink  Well that's the MGM grand . and staff that don't give a dam it just seams to be the norm there there are much better hotels near bye
plus^Being one night at a location that was mentioned in Ocean's Eleven - but that was it...
minus^>30 minutes waiting in line to check-in, impersonal (sure, it's one of the largest hotels in the world but for the price I would expect a different treatment of the guests), one of the towels was more a rag than a towel, we actually booked the parking pass when checking-in but when we tried to exit the parking garage it didn't work and we were told that we didn't book it; They could have make a larger/better visible note on the fridge in the room that one is more or less not supposed to open the fridge unless you are buying something. Over in all: disappointing and not 4 stars worthy
plus^At check in we were offered a free upgrade and the administrator really tried to make our stay more convenient by placing us together with other couple that we traveled with, and who had booked the rooms much later on a separate reservation.
minus^We took Standard room and ended up with two double beds instead of king/queen bed (and we are newlyweds so one bed remained unused of course!) To some facilities you need to go through Casino always (or so it seems) and it is permitted to smoke in casino, so you get to breathe the smoke while going to someplace else really.
plus^Location on the strip is good. Quality of the rooms are good and everything is clean. Swimming pools were excellent and casino is a good one.
minus^Had to queue for an hour to check in!! Car park 20 min walk from the room, no exaggeration, and no offer to take bags to the room. $10 a day for parking even though we were paying to stay there. Hidden costs as soon as we check in, nothing included, couldn't even use the fridge for our own drinks or we would get charged. Just not the friendliest place, constantly trying to get money from you. Also a personal opinion but its too big! It takes 15 minutes to get anywhere. Would stay somewhere else if going to Vegas again.
minus^Room didn't have a fridge. Was charged a daily fee to request one. For what I paid for this room it should have included a fridge at no extra charge. Won't stay here again.
plus^Great place to venture onto the Strip. Lovely swimming area.
minus^In the pool area there was very little shade. There were a few 'fabric houses' people could rent but for most people you had to be in the sun. There were no parasols. When there is concern about skin cancer it was very surprising that there was no shade.
plus^Close to the strip and convenient to have nice bars and restaurants in the hotel.
minus^To check in was over an hour long.   The place was littered with young drunk kids (Vegas of course), but there were spilled drinks everywhere, I slipped and fell and told a staff member, yet nothing was done about it. Couples were engaging in inappropriate activity in the elevator.  Would be nice if there was someone watching over the elevator entrances or if security was around.
plus^I front desk was really nice and helpful when I checked in.  And checking out was a breeze
minus^People were arguing in the next room around 3:00 am in the morning.  But, that's expected in Vegas, right?
minus^Exposed to CANCEROUS air conditions. No clean air to breath. Hair stinking of cancer causing cigarette smoke, clothing stinking of cigarette smoke, body stinking and covered with cigarette smoke. Left facility with lungs concentrated with cancer smoke, unable to find any clean air. Las Vegas Nevada STINKS and exposes all to cancer filled air.  2. Casino machines are programed to eliminate payoffs. No quality Black entertainers. Will recommend to all DO NOT VISIT LAS VEGAS.
plus^Excellent pool complex; good variety of food on a week day in the hotel's buffet;  hassle free and quick checkout; Spacious rooms; Good housekeeping; Free safe; Good sports bar and the Hakkasan club Overall very good atmosphere  Very quick response to a minor maintenance issue
minus^Slow checking in and expensive pool bars; reduced food options in the hotel's buffet at the weekend; not enough waitress' serving slot machines; room lighting too dark
plus^The smoke free room and smoke free floor. Room was clean and spacious .
minus^This hotel is not suited to families we stayed on the non-smoking floor but constantly having to walk through smoke to get to everything didn't help. The walls were like tissue paper on 2 of the 3 nights we were woken at 430 to people having a party in the next room. The pool was lovely but you need to pack a cut lunch to get to it.
plus^Room very comfortable, staff very helpful, hotel very accessible to the strip.
minus^Not a big fan of smoking, but the casino's extraction system seemed to work pretty well.
plus^We were treated very well and had a great experience. Thank you!!!
minus^Got lost a few times - my bad sense of direction  I don't think water should be $4.50!!
plus^Not much really. It's a great hotel but you get what you pay for. The room was a good size and cleaned each day. But was not what I expected.
minus^Room was dark and had a window looking at a building 5 meters away. Checking in was long, when I come again I will just hand my bad in store room and go to look around and come back after the rush. Else it's a 60min wait.
minus^Not a lot... I guess you get what you pay for but you would expect even the cheap rooms in a hotel/casino in vegas of this name would be nice but the wing we were in felt old, run down and a little bit dirty feeling. Plus the hot water in the shower only ever got to luke warm. Very disappointed 
plus^This hotel has everything you could possibly need. You wouldn't even need to leave!  Especially loved the pools, we would definitely stay again. 
minus^Disappointed we were not told that the $100 per night bond will not be refunded until up to 10 working days after you check out. Not ideal when your doing an O.E around America 
plus^The pool was nice.
minus^Our room type was not honored.  We reserved a king bed, they tried to push us into a 2 queen room.  We're a married couple.  After arguing for some time they put us into a king room in the old tower.  Terrible check in experience.  Maybe we should have booked through hotel directly...
plus^The bed was nice, the hotel is iconic......
minus^It was let down by the room..... Described as a Deluxe King it was small with a trendy new bathroom/shower arrangement, people do like privacy, don't change what ain't broken!!
plus^Good location  Reasonably priced
minus^The bedroom was quite small, the toilet was part of the bedroom so when you were doing your business your travel companion will hear it all!! The floors all around the hotel esp the corridors to the rooms could do with a good hoover. Stayed in the venetian for 3 nights prior to this... only 60 dollars difference and the standard is well worth such a small amount.
plus^Not our first stay at the MGM and decided to return due to the great pool area and the fact it is such a well known casino and hotel.
minus^Location on the strip means everywhere is a long walk... Not always great in heels! Hotel is looking tired and in need of a refurb.  West wing rooms are too small for more than 1 person in a room, air con is rubbish and no water/ fridge facilities in room. Staff were generally disinterested and it was the only hotel on our 6 stop honeymoon that didn't even congratulate us... Not a great personal service. As a hotel they want to charge a fortune for everything.... The room costs almost double when the tax and 'resort fee' is added, late checkout of just 2 hours costs extra and even inflatables at the pool are charged! When added to the high costs for drinks, food etc both at the pool and casino it was an extortionate 5 nights away in what is a 3 star hotel now at best.
plus^Location was great
minus^We had to wait almost 2 hrs to check in to hotel and then we were given the wrong room number and had to call front desk to sort it out and they told us it was the wrong room number and there is no free wi-fi because we were charged a hotel service fee of $32 us dollars and when I question the fee i was told it was for the wi-fi and pool services and we also hired a car and was charged a $10 us dollar a night fee for parking in the hotel carpark that we needed to use our room key to enter the car park but we had to go to the front desk twice because it didn't work hotel was very noisy with people running up and down hallways in hotel yelling and screaming at all hours of the night and some of the staff were very short when asked questions about hotel services i would never stay at the mgm grand again
minus^We were not able to place anything in the refrigerator otherwise we were charged a fee of $50.00 per day. If we asked housekeeping to keep any perishables it was $25 per day. Would have thought access was included in the room price. Did not like waiting 30-40 minutes to check in.
plus^Overall everyone was very nice.
minus^I had problems with a smell coming from the sink.  I tried to get them to fix for 3 days.  Still smelled when I was leaving after 5 days.  (Sink smelled of sewer water.)
plus^Great location and beautiful accommodations with awesome views from the room. Slot machines seemed nicely loose (witnessed a multi-thousand dollar jackpot!) and floor personal and wait staff were readily available and helpful.  The number of elevators was more than adequate, and the response/transport time was very timely.
minus^The noise from neighboring rooms' blinds being adjusted could be heard quite loudly through the vents/walls, which was a bit unsettling at all hours of the stay.  Check-In line was clearly marked, as were Room Keys & Infromation and Express Check-Out lines, but there was a bit of confusion as to which line one used to check-out at the counter.
plus^The location. The pool. The rooms. The staff. Everything
minus^I asked for a West Wing room and was given a room on the OTHER end of the hotel and not given a reason why.
plus^The restaurants onsite were all excellent. Location was great - easy to just walk across over to NY NY for a little variety.
minus^Really long lines at check in.
plus^I liked that everything is available in one place. You don't have to leave the hotel at all. Club is amazing!
minus^I didn't like that housekeeping came in to our room around 6 pm just to let us know they were going to charge me 50 dollars to my credit card only because i left a water bottle in the refrigerator. Also, housekeeping was banging on our door around 9 causing the baby to wake up and check out wasn't until 11.
minus^Excellent location and everything you could possibly want in a hotel. Went on a girls holiday and the club hakkasan was fantastic and so handy inside the hotel. The buffet is amazing definitely recommend
minus^This hotel is massive with a total of 8000 rooms. So be prepared to walk for a good 10 mins to exit the hotel, access the casinos from your room  and so on. The rooms are pretty dull and run down, we booked a standard room and we called room service when we realised we didn't have a refrigerator and they said we'd have to pay $20 per night to rent it. we thought it was insane given that we were there in August, it was 38C and some cold beers or water would have been nice after coming back hot and dehydrated.  We stayed at MGM for 2 nights and for the 3rd night we moved to Venetian!!! So much nicer, brighter and fun.
minus^We stayed for 3 nights during the labour day weekend. We got a upgrade to a room with a strip view even when we didn't initially book it without any hassle. Also there was a leak in the bathroom so my bags got all wet. They compensated us half the room rent for one night and the resort fee for the entire stay. a good $300 in total....awesome gift at the end of an awesome weekend.
plus^Modern room decoration and there is a BOSE radio alarm clock in the room as well. Foreign TV (Chinese) channels also available.
minus^Room size very smaller compared to other similar hotels I stayed.
plus^The location is great, easy walk to the new TV Mobile stadium. Easy highway access. 
minus^It's the MGM Grand of course it's amazing but the upkeep is falling behind. The gold dome in the lobby half the lights are dead and rust is forming. Wallpaper peeling in halls, carpets are filthy and old on our floor. Silicone in shower is lifting and drying out. Fiance dropper her earing and under the night stand was a half cup of crushed crackers and dust bunnies. We didn't have a controller to the television or any towels. The front desk supervisor was very apologetic but then it took 25 minutes for housekeeping to bring them.
plus^Fantastic hotel. Awesome. This is Las Vegas. Can't believe all the new hotels/resorts in past 15 years...
minus^Queue to check in.... Visit clashed with firefighters conference... Perhaps this could have been separate...
plus^The price seemed too good to be true.
minus^The musty moldy smell of the lobbies (not just the doorways) was so bad the board of health should come in and inspect for BLACK MOLD. I waited about 45 minutes to check in and was coughing and hoarse so much so that I had to leave the building.  Horrible. We used to love this place!! Tear it down.
minus^Buffet very regular menu,  very expensive. Not that great, David Copperfield show..not inpresive.was hoping for that vegas glamour magic show..not even close.
plus^The facility , the location .
minus^Nobody care as no one  approached us when we arrived and it took the receptionist 45 minutes to find our reservation even though I had the hard copy of it and no smile in the staff face even though they are working in one of the best Hotle in the most famues city .
plus^Pools were good . Room was clean . Location was good .
minus^To start with we were charged a load of extras at the desk . Tax was added on top which we were aware of but then there was a resort few and another 400$ security deppsit . I'm very well travelled abs never came across this expensive security deposit. The guy serving us could not have been less interested in out shock or why we asked him to break it down to us  . The hotel prices were extortionate - 5.50 for a tiny water - I could go on . The hotel is packed busy . Rooms were average enough nothing special .
plus^1. Location is very close to airport, just 5 minutes by taxi or aorport shuttle bus. 2. Room was big and clean.  3, I really recommend David Copperfield showed, you must to see.  If you had M-life card, you also had discount for ticket. (M life is member card, very easily became member by internet access.) 4. Buy one day tour to grand canyon, the tour will pick you up and sent you back at the door of hotel.
minus^A lot of people, this make me do not feel private. Staff was no enough too.
plus^Location
minus^They tried to charge a higher resort fee than what I booked.  I only noticed because I checked my deposit.  The water out of the faucet tastes terrible, even just to brush your teeth with.  The water out of the purified filter in the buffet was only slightly better.  There was poor water pressure in the shower.  The thermostat doesn't go below 65 so I was hot for the entire stay.  The hotel is a little dated and could use some updating, especially in public areas.  There is no coffee maker in the room because they have multiple Starbucks.  However, their version of Starbucks doesn't accept the Starbucks cards or rewards.  Due to this, a coffee maker should be available upon request.  Also, at the rate of the room and number of nights we stayed, parking should be included!  Otherwise it is $10/day. The straw that broke the camel's back: they no longer have the lion exhibit.
plus^Very nice pool. Front desk was polite.The buffet was great.
minus^The toilet ran all night the first night after getting there at 1am. They never did fix it properly. We just put up with it. My daughter was across the hall and we didn't want to change rooms.
plus^I liked the location I thought the taxi line and how to get one was organized
minus^Staff members were not always polite  Ons of people smoking in the non smoking rooms filtered in The food was not worth the price  This hotel is more of a 21 year old hotel then my age which is 30's
plus^Everything about this hotel was excellent the staff were great and friendly the food was great beds were comfortable, blackout blinds were greats do  even though we were in a casino on a high floor it was still nice and quite,lifts were quick also.
minus^Need a better check in system there was no word of lie about 250 people checking in when we checked in it took like 2 hrs in line to get through but you can get a drink from down stairs and drink while you wait lol I don't know if this was because of end of school holidays or if this was normal it was a Wednesday afternoon.
plus^Super accomadating, clean, accurate w charges.l, very kind staff! Casino had it all!
minus^Everything was fabulous except for the in-casino stores, for everyday items, pricing for items (razor/shaving cream/sunblock/chips/food/drink, etc) was ridiculously high! Very discouraging!!! $30 for a disposable razor and small travel size shaving cream was $29!!
minus^Tap in the sink was stuck and despite several requests, it was not fixed. I hurt my hand trying to use it and when I complained, they just didn't care.  Got bitten by bed bugs so badly that I had to see a doctor when I returned.
plus^Big hotel. Good location. Has a small shop in it.
minus^Hour and a half check in. The room wasn't great. Got an upgrade with a view to the strip that was a view to a roof.  CHARGED FOR PARKING !!! RIDICIOULUS !!! No minibar use in the room ! They hve the Hakasan Club but the workers there think it's the kingdom of heaven with their attitude !  Hey it's just a club in the desert. Get over it. It'll be history in a year ! The hotel is cool tho. Good young crowd.
plus^All of the staff was friendly and professional. The buffet was indeed grand and the hotel is near a shuttle to other resorts. Also the pool area was exceptional.
minus^We were prompted to upgrade to a better room during our check in. After the first night, we realized we could hear helicopters coming and going and while the view was great, we kept our window closed most of the time to get some sleep. We asked to downgrade before breakfast but it took us calling back several times to get a room, near 6pm, (almost making us late for our show). The original, less expensive room was quaint and cozy, it had a feather-bed and just as comfortable. I regret making the initial upgrade, further away from the exit we used to get to the strip, that really wasn't to our benefit.
plus^The hotel is well placed on the strip there is a lot to do and see. There is good entertainment with a good variety of different acts and events to visit.
minus^When we arrived we had a 2 hour wait for our room allocation. There was hundreds of people waiting with only limited staff. I then found that the hotel charge me $35 more than the agreed rate. It took me most of the following day to get this money back.
plus^The bed was amazingly comfortable.  The pool was great loved the dj   House keeping staff were lovely.  The meal at the pub was awesome and the staff there were very friendly.
minus^The cocktail waitresses were slow with drinks even with a good tip.
plus^Good location.
minus^Every 3 hrs (yes at night), the water system or AC made a loud whooshing sound for about 20 seconds. Difficult to sleep! Also, someone who stayed in room prior to me must have spilled beer on the floor. When I arrived, the carpet was wet, and the room reeked of beer.
plus^Have stayed before and the location is excellent
minus^We had book through booking.com and unfortunately, when we arrived, they did not have our reservation.  Fortunately I had the reservation on my phone, but they did not honor the price and we are still dealing with this situation.
plus^It has a nice location. Its kept clean. The rooms are comfortable
minus^Nothing is complementary, they charge for the air you breathe. The waitresses are slow and few. I paid extra to stay in a nice hotel  thinking it would give me benefits. I was wrong, i had to pay to get in their club and pool party(which is not cheap 60 a person). On top of that they over pack the clubs and pool partys till u cant move. The open pool is juz as nice and not pack to the max. And of course the drinks are overpriced 10 a beer which i expected the prices to be high but i was thinking like 7 a beer not 10. I basically could have stayed at a cheaper hotel and still got all the benefits the actual guests get. I literally see no benefits for paying as much as i did to stay in this nice hotel. I would of enjoyed my trip much more if i wouldn't of wasted as much money as i did on the room and spent more on activities cuz all i did was sleep in the room. I will not be stayin here my next trip or ever
plus^If you like Las Vegas, then this is certainly a good place to be. And we really, really appreciated the free upgrades when we checked in the first time. Wow, those suites are really roomy and nice! If you want everything in one place, never having to leave the hotel, then it works well.
minus^Like all the casinos it seems, this place is huge. I mean just figuring out where to go and how to get out of the hotel is a challenge. When I booked the rooms, I thought they were quite inexpensive. But then there's the resort fee and the parking which is no longer free, and the food is expensive. It used to be quite cheap in the casinos, but those days are long gone. All in all, it just cost more than I had originally planned.
plus^The MGM Grand is right on Las Vegas Blvd and couldn't be more in the middle of the action. We booked early, so parking was also free for us - that was a nice surprise! The pools are fantastic, and of course there's lots of other things to do even without leaving the hotel.
minus^We had a room in the West Wing. To everybody who is staying in the MGM Grand: Try getting a room in the center towers, not in the West Wing - especially on the lower floors the view is not very nice (we were on 2nd floor and there was a wall about 6 ft. from the window).  We were offered the chance to get a different room if we inquire at the registration, but it was so crowded there all the time that we didn't bother. But anyway, you're not in Vegas to look out of the window...
plus^Wet Republic was awesome.
minus^The hotels internet  wifi is VERY slow. You constantly need to sign on and it kicks you out about 30 times a day. You cannot get any work done- so dont even try it.
plus^The spa was nice but did not have bubble soap. It was supposed to be a jacuzzi but had no pumps to pump out bubbles. Just felt like a big bathtub. The shower wasnt so great either and the bed was small for a king. It wouldve been better if there was a microwave in the room. Overall the size of the room was good but wasnt worth almost 900$ for just two nights
minus^There wasnt a microwave, enough towels, the jacuzzi looked like a big bathtub. We expected to at least offer free bubble soap if there were no pumps for the tub
plus^Great clean room very comfortable beds.  Great buffet lots of food choices.  Pool was a little far away just because the hotel is so big.  Check in early or late to avoid long lines.
minus^Long walk to pool.  Check in lines.
plus^The casino was amazing
minus^The receptionist was not very helpful, told us ambiguous information which meant we got billed for stuff we thought were included
minus^The room that was given to me, at 3 am someone tried to get it and they didn't have record that o was checking out from the room on Sunday .. Saturday morning housekeeping was knocking at my room saying we need to checkout .. Even though my reservation was until Sunday .. Not going back
plus^Excellent facilities, friendly helpful staff, great location.
minus^Rooms very dusty.  Electrical sockets very old and positively dangerous and food outlets very expensive and lack of healthy breakfast choices.
plus^The mirror in the bathroom was beautiful
minus^When booking I was told I could get a smoking room. At check in I came to find out no room in the entire hotel was a smoking room. Also when checking in I immediately asked about a later checkout time and they told me to call back the day of and it'll be taken care of, when doing so I was told We don't have that. Received a lot of the runaround it seemed.
plus^Great Hotel, Rooms are very nice, pool is great and everything is very clean.
minus^It took 3 hours to check in which I find disgraceful. No one should have to wait that long to check in.
plus^We upgraded our room after the first two nights to a Grand Tower room which was stunning. The views blew us away. Its a huge hotel but felt easier to navigate than most we visited. Drinks weren't as expensive as expected, and the location is excellent especially as it has it's own monorail stop for when you're feeling too tired to walk. The champagne breakfast buffet was fab!
minus^Long check in queues at certain times but easy check out options made up for this. It was also a very long walk to our first room in the west wing. I loved that room and was surprised how big it was but there was no separate door into the bathroom area which is right by the main door (the shower and toilet had doors of course) so i know this may not please everyone. It also had limited natural light and no views as we werent up high enough. I had no issue though and the shower in that room was fantastic!
plus^Courteous staff who checked us in right away instead of waiting for about 50 + people in line to check in.  Our family came back to MGM because we had a great time at this hotel once.
minus^Hostile room accommodation. E.g. the use of refrigerator and being charged for restocking it. No exorbitant prices on beverages on display.  Knowing all this, made our stay uneasy and uncomfortable.
plus^Location, the room is large, good facilities, comfortable.
minus^In our room , the bed is not clean , the ceiling of the bathroom leaks when someone take a shower above us , so we call the front desk immediately they transferred us to other room .
minus^rude staff at check in, not possible to get same rate as walk in as on the internet. very loud, also guests are loud and it felt more like a stag night hotel and not lux.
plus^The property was beautifully designed and decorated.The staff was friendly and handed out beverages to the customers waiting in check-in line. 
minus^All water in this hotel was HORRIBLE. In the hotel all I could smell was a VERY STRONG chlorine like chemical smell. It made me feel so sick trying to take a shower. Even brushing my teeth and washing my face in the room sink was a terrible experience. Exiting downstairs from the room elevators is a large fountain that burned my eyes and lungs from the chemicals . What's strange is that the pool water didn't have a smell like the drinking and bathing water did. My overall experience with the Hotel was pleasant. I will be back but hopefully the water gets better.
plus^Location, decor, room comfort, safety and security.
minus^If reception notified us on checking in that the mini bar was weight sensored. We didn't know, and although we didn't use anything from the bar, we were still charged. Not happy with that at all and we have advised the hotel of this.
minus^Loved it all!! Pool area, beds very comfy in rooms, concierge very helpful, lots of restaurants etc to choose from!!good location at end of the strip ready to explore the rest of Vegas!!
plus^The friendliness of staff. The cleanliness and comfort of room was outstanding.
minus^One night the water was turned off and I had to get ready for a show. I was attending the Steve Harvey Neighborhood Awards.
minus^Massive hotel, very spacious and comfortable rooms, big casino's, good location, friendly staff, possibility to park your car by yourself. This hotel is an experience on itself (but don't miss to visit some other ones though)
plus^Extra large room and beds super comfy. Enough space for us and our teenage daughter to stay. Prompt attention by security to resolve an issue with the in room safe.
minus^Constant drilling from 8:00 in the morning which couldn't be identified. Housekeeping had their own radios on in the corridors playing music at 8:00 in the morning. Noisy young revelers at the weekend. Hotel is too large and noisy. Takes forever to walk to any of the facilities! Hotel prices for drink and food over the top.
plus^Our bedroom was large and had a nice view.
minus^Lessons learnt:  1. A 600-USD double room (breakfast not included) does not necessarily come with a smile at check-in, coffee machine in the room or even the right to cool a yogurt in the minibar (unless you are ready to pay 50 USD - see enclosed photo).  2. Insist on receiving the services you were promised (I didn't).  Since our children were staying in a separate room, I had inquired over the phone about adjacent rooms. I was told that there were always enough of them and that I only needed to mention this request at check-in. When we arrived around 6:30 pm, the staff member told me that the floor we had booked on (Stay well) had no adjacent rooms. This turned out to be uncorrect - our room did indeed have a communicating door, but the children's room was across the corridor instead of next to ours. 3. Be ready to pay for valet.  Another unpleasant experience was finding one's way to the guests parking lot and then walking from there to the main lobby (which is at least 150 yards away and there are no carts in the guests parking lot). Valet service is expensive but life is hard for those who think they don't need it. 4. This was our first and last stay at MGM Grand.
plus^I love the location because I was there for an event one night stay. I liked the bedding n comfort it was good. 
minus^The lady at check in was good. My family and I was traveling and we had reserved 3 rooms. We requested to be close to each other or same floor which we were accommodated however, upon entering our rooms one of the room was not cleaned. My cousin had to leave for a few hours while the room was being cleaned. My room had left over food in the refrigerator and around the foot of the beds. Requested for cleaning and no one showed up. We were here for one night I was too tired to deal with the sloppiness. I spoke to front desk and was told our resort fees would be waived instead I was charged for food n beverages which we did not eat any of it being as nasty as it was. I will never stay here ever again its ridiculous!! I will also be disputing the over charge the most poor service I've recieve in Vegas and I'm regular traveler.
plus^Friendly staff, good portions on room service (made me understand the prices), easy check in and out, great pool, convenient location.
minus^Room was very old. The bottom of the shower was clean but looked like it was the bottom of a locker room shower, with cracks, stains, discoloration. I felt like I should have been wearing shower shoes. Took 2-5 minutes for water to heat up and would jump between hot and cold during showers. TV in bathroom mirror didn't work. Bed and pillows were not that comfortable. No mini bar or fridge. No counter space in the bathroom or barricade from the bathroom to rest of the room. A door would be nice.
plus^Access to variety of facilities, shopping, entertainment, dining. Neat modern, restyled rooms.
minus^Due to miscommunication between Bookings and MGM, my booking was accidentally cancelled by MGM. Hoped to have full access to pool facilities, but only one very crowded pool was left open. AC in room didn't work well.
plus^Excellent tower suite room, very spacious  Lovely pool complex
minus^No hot drink facilities in the room, real feeling of making you pay for everything  Very long check in and check out queue  Shops and cafes within hotel extortionate 
plus^Great to be on the Las Vegas strip, & in the same property as the show Ka.
minus^Non smoking room smelt faintly of smoke - until air con had been going for some time. Lumpy pillows.
plus^Bed was super comfy and it was relatively quiet where we were. There were a huge variety of food places to eat which was great and altogether it was a pretty good stay! A great party hotel if that is what you are after. Wet Republic was great.
minus^The west wing could do with being refurbished as it's a little dated now. Also, not having a mini fridge was a minus and while the place would be great if you were with a bunch of people and not leaving too often, it was a bit further away from where all the other casinos/hotels are.
plus^Beautiful hotel. Rooms very nice with great amenities. You could basically stay in the hotel and never leave.  Good location on the strip and has its own stop on the monorail which was very handy.
minus^Its a big hotel with a lot of people going in and out so I didn't feel there was much customer service. Even at check-in the queue was out the door. It was the same level of service you get when you check in at the airport. Not unfriendly but not very personable.
minus^The room was dirty and had a very bad smell There was dirty towels on the floor of the bathroom when we arrived at 12:00am We had to be moved due to the fact the first room was not cleaned after the previous guests left  If was unsettling to go into a dark room and think people were sleeping in bed. I was attending a conference and had to leave early as I felt ill.  When I got back to my room the key did not work and had to call security 3 times and wait for almost 30 min before someone came up to open the door
plus^I've stayed here before and once again, it did not disappoint.  The hotel / casino only keeps getting better and better!
minus^The beds were comfortable but I've definitely had much softer / more comfortable beds at other hotels in Las Vegas.  That's the only upgrade I would recommend for the hotel to make.
plus^Comfortable spacious rooms. Huge pools and lazy river kids spent all day in. Lots of restaurants.
minus^Prepare yourself to stand in a huge cue at check in. Takes about 1.5hrs! It's probably too big for me. They actually charged our card twice. But we can get that sorted out when we get home, so I wouldn't really put it against the place.
plus^Room was excellent.  Nice view.
minus^Check in staff was very rude and it took forever to checkin with long lines.  We drove 19 hours straight cause I love seeing the country side they should let people know that check in lines are more than an hour long. No coffee in the room, fridge or microwave to warm up food.  We were lied to and not informed properly about debit card policies.  Not everyone wants credit cards, felt like we were getting punished for paying cash by having to put $400 deposit.  No acknowledgement about our marriage not even a free dinner.
plus^Rooms large
minus^Checkin line was horrendous.  90 mins.  This check in time is apparently good it took another guest 2.5 hours the day before! We were allocated two rooms in two different towers and they charged extra to move children's room closer. The hotel has over 5,000 rooms so we needed the kids room to be near ours! Pool opened at 8am. Lazy River opened at 1000 and closed at 5. Why? No pool toys allowed.  No shade around pool and no umbrellas at pool to be had.  Charged 8 Dollars for medium water bottle so you either dehydrate or go bankrupt! We had ladies of the night in room next to us and we called security 3 times between midnight and 3am but management refused to move us!  Three Scottish gentlemen in the room next to us in a one bed room, so they don't allow you pool toys incase of MGM getting sued but allow three grown men to share a double bed and allow you to burn your bits off around the pool as don't provide parasols. Thankfully we found factor 100 sun cream. MGM also make it very difficult to find the exit onto the strip. They want you to stay at their hotel as much as possible.  These hotels are like huge shopping complexes so research each hotel carefully as you may wish to be more central on the strip as walking down the strip takes forever and isn't funny when it is 45 degrees and like walking down Oxford Street on the busiest shopping day of the year.   We did have a good time in Vegas but very disappointed at the managements response to having ladies of the night next to our connecting room which upset ourselves and my 13 year old daughter.
plus^We really enjoyed the swimming pool and lazy river. Didn't really enjoy the gambling because there weren't any great black jack tables offered.
minus^The buffet was horrible. There were hardly any food when we are around 8:30 pm.  The foods weren't available or were all gone.  The lady who cut up the prime rib wouldn't give 2 slices but instead one thin slice. I expected a 5 star buffet but I felt like I was eating at Hometown buffet where it's a 3 star buffet only.
plus^All the staff were very nice. Loved the swimming pool choices.
minus^Didn't care for the resort fees and the parking fees that were charged on top of the room rates.
plus^We liked Cynthia when we checked in. We liked the Lazy River. We liked that the hotel was in a central location.
minus^The ventalation in the smoking areas were poor. The line at check in was ridiculous. The food and drink was way too expensive.
plus^MGM was the perfect stay for a group of girlfriends. Rooms were spacious, clean and beds were super comfy! Everything was in walking distance. Staff was super helpful - will be staying here for the next trip for sure!
minus^Check in was a long wait (expect to be waiting at least 2 hours). No one seems to tell you this but due to of the number of guests staying it's insanely busy.
plus^Comfortable bed. Quiet
minus^Too many extra charges once I arrive. Purchased the room for $89.00. Ended up paying $145 once I left. The light in the bathroom went out. Had to shower and brush my teeth in the dark. The phone next to the bed never had a dial tone so I couldn't call downstairs unless I called from the toilet. For the amount of money I was charged, I was very disappointed with my stay. I've been coming to the MGM for years, but was not impressed with this visit.
plus^Go see Cirque du Soleil's Ka.  Wonderful show with battle scenes on vertical wall.  Excellent production housed at MGM Grand Theater.  Very friendly staff with clean facilities.  Easy check out.     Room service prices ridiculously expensive, like over $10 for coffee!  In fact, I believe a pot of coffee was about $18 off the room service menu.  Ate breakfast last day at Avenue Cafe (American Restaurant) on site because the line to the buffet was insanely long.  Very good food at the cafe with excellent coffee!
minus^Prior to my stay, someone left behind a bag of dirty laundry in a plastic bag in one of the nightstand drawers. Staff should make sure to check all drawers while readying the rooms.  Also, the bathroom was a bit dusty upon arrival.
plus^Loved the amount of pools at the MGM Grand and the room sizes were great
minus^The bed is uncomfortable and when either myself or my husband moved, the whole bed shook. The pillows are also uncomfortable. The bathroom only had shampoo conditioner and soap, no other amenities which would be good
plus^Locations, entertainments (David Copperfield)
minus^Bathroom was not cleaned. Used towels left on the floor when we just entered the room. Long line for checking in.
plus^The bed was comfortable and the front desk staff were the only ones we encountered that were happy and glad to serve us.
minus^Staff was rude at the salon, buffet, and side shops. Room was dirty and after calling housekeeping up to reclean they still missed spots like the windows and tub
plus^The staff was very friendly.
minus^There's no Ethernet connections in each room for the business traveler, this is not a good choice for business travelers who need to utilize a VOIP desktop phone for conference calls etc.
plus^I liked the location
minus^I didn't like  that there was no coffee in rooms and no fridges.. Everything was an extra cost.. Hotel was dated.. I would not stay there again
plus^Our two queen rooms were upgraded to an enormous suite which was amazing.  Very comfortable beds.  Easy access to Las Vegas Boulevard.
minus^We queued for more than 1 hour to check in.  Have never seen a queue for check in this long at any other hotel.
minus^The MGM was lovely, we were really happy with our stay. The staff couldn't do enough for us and were more than happy when we decided to add an extra night to let us upgrade the standard room we had to the deluxe king which was fab. It also had so much going on in the hotel that there was also something to do if you didn't feel like going out on to the strip.
plus^Extremely big in accordance the image we have of Vegas
minus^1h standing in the line to check in Automatic billing of the room snacks if the children touched... There are sensors ...
minus^The room stank and the attitude in this place is brutal. I will never stay or recommend this place. In addition, the difference between your Booking.com fee and all the surprise fees/charges on check-in left a very sour taste in my mouth... So much so that I will never use your site and will most certainly discourage my friends and social network (over 10,000 connections) to not use you.
plus^Only stayed for the Cirque Show which was wonderful. Room was comfortable.
minus^No longer has free parking for guests. Took over an hour to check  in due to long queue. Smoking in gaming halls is horrible. No way to get around without walking through slots area.
plus^Everything was excellent. Room was a nice size & very well appointed. We had a great view of the strip. Bed was super comfy. Location for tram was great. Staff was helpful & nice. Check in line was enormous, however there were plenty of staff to move the line along quickly. Check in was quick & easy. We were able to upgrade our room for a nominal amount. We had a great stay!
minus^Shower pressure was a little weak & water didn't get hot enough.
plus^The location is perfect, the hotel amennities are great .
minus^The price of water & food inside the ref of room is too expensive , no free coffee inside the roomi and the product in the bathroom smell for male only too harm smell. Bad experience on last night , no staff clean our room , need to call front desk to bring towel ( towel are not freshly clean , old and with hole. Also the door on tower room is so noisy if someone pass the hall way.
plus^Affordable food in the food court area, and the fun lazy river (until we had to evacuate due to fecal matter in the pool).
minus^Room was not clean enough upon check-in. We had to have it re-cleaned. Overall atmosphere is a bit like a frat house--great if you are in your 20's, not so much for younger or older.
plus^As compensation for standing in line for over an hour to check in, we were upgraded to a north tower suite without even complaining or asking...very nice customer service
minus^Location is a bit south of my preference
plus^I like the room and good location
minus^We can't smoke in the room and when we do check in was a big lien and charge a lot and charge full price in club and in all MGM like no discount for nothing!
plus^The hotel staff was incredibly helpful, friendly and accommodating!!
minus^Our room was out dated and had no view of anything. The whole layout of the hotel/casino was confusing
minus^This hotel is packed full of gangs of pumped up young guys getting drunk. Not so classy. Vegas isn't entirely suitable for families but this hotel is for stag and hen parties. Which is fine if you're in a stag/hen.
plus^MGM has a huge selection of restaurants - location is great. The actual hotel is fantastic and a huge selection of pools.
minus^They overbook the rooms so many people like ourselves turned up on arrival to find out we had been down-graded. To start with they offered 100 credit to spend in a hotel and eventually after further complaints from us they discounted the room rate. Although they went some way to compensating their mistake - we paid for a suite and that is what we expected.  Check in is also very slow at peak times - expect a wait of up to an hour as people complain about the security deposit they weren't aware they had to pay
plus^Location
minus^Completely lied to about resort fees, told to open a loyalty card and they would be waived, just come back to loyalty card office upon checkout, upon arrival, they were wrong, you shouldn't have been told that.  On top of a less than stellar room, a malfunctioning express checkout (had to wait in two Vegas style lines to checkin and checkout) this will be the last time I stay at MGM.  I have stayed there several times before because I love the lazy river pool but this time was atrocious.....spreading the word too.
minus^We noticed that when ordering drinks in the poolside bar, there was absolutely no alcohol in the blended drinks. None. So we were paying $24 for those blended alcohol drinks. We finally just switched to the strawberry blended drinks that were $9.50. Next time we come we will  be ordering the cheaper strawberry drinks and adding our own alcohol. Many other people noticed the blended drinks had no alcohol either. What a rip off.
plus^Large and comfortable rooms Amazing swimming pool with all facilities and a lot of space to relax.  Great fitness room
minus^No space in the hotel to sit and relax but at the gambling machine area.  Housekeeping not made everyday in the rooms  Smoking smell in the common areas  Despite MGM, no specific theme or internal design unlike most of the other hotels
plus^Free room upgrade. Pleasant staff. We were there for UFC 200 and the hotel was perfect for that in terms of events and build up. Excellent location.
minus^Shops were extremely pricey, $7 for water is insanity.
plus^Room was really nice and the bed was very comfortable.
minus^I gave a 300 deposit expecting to get most if not all of it back and then I found out I owed an extra 75 dollars.  And I didn't trash the room or anything like that.  In fact I cleaned it up pretty nice before I checked out.
plus^The room was small but very clean and modern. Love the pool!!!!
minus^The check in line was too long (1 hour) More information (booklets, discounted coupons, etc)
plus^Helpful staff, easy access to strip and highways (with or without car), multi use parking lot key in other MGM owned Hotels
minus^Long check in queue, the room was smelling smoke although front desk helped it to change the room right away, air conditioning of the building was making to much noise (4th floor - King suite)
minus^Front desk staff was amazing!  Keep in mind if you will be parking your car at the hotel, it is $10.00 per day which is added at the end of your stay. They explain this to you upon check-in so no surprises at check out!  Even though it was very busy we were able to get checked in quick. Easy breezy!  The pools were amazing by the way!
plus^Spacious room, large bathroom.
minus^Room smelled like rotting food or fish upon arrival, minibar button was broken so had no access, room was supposed to be a one bedroom tower suite not a spa suite so no private bedroom, room had very little ventilation. No bathrobe in room :(
plus^The rooms had cool paintings and the hotel is huge with a great pool and a million things to do. Awesome place
minus^The room was far from the elevator and lines were really long at front desk. I forgot my bag in the room when I checked out and I went to lost and found who redirected me to the bell desk who redirected me to lost and found again who redirected me to some other line. MGM needs a better concierge service
plus^Nice central location, easy to/from airport. Friendly staff in general. A bit busy and big but was not disturbing. Quiet enough for good sleep:-)
minus^Broken shelf in the room
plus^that if you didn't want to leave the hotel you didn't have to as their were excellent entertainment facilities on site, easy access to monorail, buffet on site had excellent selection of food, that it was on the strip, close to other places of interest
minus^long check in wait times, they had an excellent amount of staff serving but wait time to book in was very long.
plus^Great property, great service.
minus^$18 a day for valet parking. Still have to tip so it was a huge eye opener. Driving from California became pricier. Makes casinos here in California less expensive.
minus^We met our west coast family out there, there was plenty for everyone to do.. the room was very nice.. and bed was comfortable and clean! The casino was alot of fun, and there were some great food choices around.
minus^Carpet in hallway looked like motel 6 outside room. Room carpet was stained and dirty. TV kept going on and off the cable. Bathroom TV only had 3-4 stations.  Left and went to Venetian
plus^It's the iconic MGM...
minus^Just when I thought we scored with our stay we walked down a hallway that went from beautiful wall paper and accents to dingy carpets and no wall paper. The inside of the room was clean wish their budget allowed them to finish their renovations
plus^Staff were nice, location was also a plus.
minus^Do not come to this hotel on a weekend, checking in will take at least 1 hour or so. Rooms are very average, way over priced for what you get even for Vegas.
plus^Size of rooms and bathroom Staff has been very helpful !! Pools are just great !! And we won at the casino !!
minus^Too bad that the toilet is inside the bathroom ... No cheap breakfast, or quite low quality
plus^+ Everything else was great. Actually the hotel is huge and it might be even possible to lose orientation! I wish we had more time to explore it.
minus^- No breakfast included. - The check-in counter had a large queue when we arrived at midnight. - Very expensive to buy water, juice, etc. from the local shops inside the hotel. - It is very difficult to find the exit of the hotel! Not enough signs.
plus^Excellent Hotel, with every facility possible and very good rooms.
minus^There is always a big line for check in which takes over an hour! There must be a better way of doing this in 2016!
plus^Tons of restaurants. Buffet was excellent. Rooms were adequate. Casino was one of the nicer ones on that part of the strip.
minus^Check in line was 2 hours long. Every single computer in the printing area was out of order. Took 15 minutes to get through to the front desk via in room phone. This was all during the supposed off season in july
plus^Location Comfortable room Complete hotel facilities
minus^Hidden charges (resort fees, etc) that are not disclosed in booking.com The shower didn't work well
plus^Conscience driving from side streets to parking easy location to get around Vegas Blvd traffic.
minus^Dirty sheets, athletes foot from shower, bed too soft, long walk from suite to parking.
plus^The croissants in the hotel shop looked nice.
minus^눉This stay was a big disappointment. In the express checkout we were overcharged by $37 for items that we didn't use from the minibar. There was no time to query this because the queues were so long so I paid the extra and complained to the hotel by email. They have not yet made the refund. It took a long time to check-in because the queues were long and it was a long walk from the self parking and the pool was closed early due to an event so we missed using the pool on the arrival day. The room carpet was tired and there was a tear in the bed sheets. We didn't buy the hotel croissants because they were so expensive ... >$5 each! Not recommended for a family with children.
plus^Good
minus^When I check out , I need somebody help me to check the Bell Trans why not to pick us from the hotel on time ? I asked the lady staff standing near the counter but she refuse to help and asked me to line up to the long queue at the information queue this make me very very angry I need to go to the airport because I had waited for such an hour feeling bad the young lady still refused to help
plus^Great pool and casino
minus^The room assigned to our kids smelled like pot, they ran out of tubes for the lazy river at 10:30am, water was shut off to our rooms one afternoon and we couldn't shower.
plus^I liked everything in this Hotel .. Place , location , staff , cleaning , atmosphere , food , pool , club , shows .. Honestly everything & am coming back soon
minus^Nothing
plus^Hour itself was wonderful.
minus^We was not happy that we were misled with the price from your website. The price we paid ended up only being for the first night and on arrival had to pay an additional $300 almost for the remainder of our stay.
plus^the bed was amazing, especially after being out in the bush for a while.  the express checkout feature comes in handy. great location and very nice big, clean and comfy rooms. even got an upgrade because it was our first stay. great value for money!
minus^it's very big like an own town. but if you're fine with that it will be awesome.
plus^Room was clean and comfortable
minus^Charging for Valet parking is outrageous. Check in lines were extreme 1 hour 10 minutes. You put an $8 charge on my bill that was not correct. Held for front desk to correct for 20 minutes and finally gave up.  So you got my $8.....
plus^I loved my Stay Well upgrade with access to the spa facilities.  The rooms were clean and very quiet.
minus^I wish I would have know the Stay Well upgrade provided a separate check-in area.  I waited 3 hours in line to check-in and found out I didn't have to :(
plus^Underground Pizza and Fat Tuesday
minus^Broken escalators poor housekeeping service ver expensive food. For the money spent there was no  condiments. No water offered after a 3 hour check line. Very disappointed after waiting 3 hours in line to be told there was a 300 deposit.
plus^Nice restaurants inside the property, plus you also have the chance to grab some food at one of the various shops. Very nice pool area
minus^Be prepared to spend some time for check in, we waited for some 60 min
minus^Calling for room service was easy and the people who answered the phone were very nice and the people who delivered the food to my room where very nice too.
plus^Comfy bed, big shower, awesome pool area, friendly staff
minus^Our room 9-507 wasn't as nice as the other rooms that were located to the closer main elevators, booked a room with 2 queens but only had a king bed.
plus^Location
minus^I spent an hour and a half waiting for check in. This was just the start of a poor experience. I was in the west hall which was far to get to , very minimalistic ,didn't include a refrigerator or any water . The alarm In the hotel went off both days at 5am Even after I asked them To fix it after it first happened . The second night my room key didn't work and I had to stand in line again at 1am to get a new card . The room service food was horrible
plus^We were on the Stay Well floor and the mattress was perfect, I would like to find out what type of mattresses are used there so I can purchase one for my bed at home.
minus^Need more people working during busy weekends in Vegas, lines to check in where ridiculous for such a popular hotel you would think it would be highly staffed or at least have backup staff available when lines are 60-100 people deep to get people checked in in a timely manner! Drinks were a bit expensive at the general pool and admission cost was way to high at Wet Republic!
minus^Really appreciated the kindness from Hana Cohen, concierge.  She was so helpful in helping us rent a car when no cars were available.  You are lucky to have such a caring and efficient employee.
plus^Lovely room, great view!
minus^Check in was an utter nightmare! 1.5 hours - after a 10 hour flight - 2 hours though airport and car hire - not what I expected? No apologies ? Just said it was summer? Nice day however the hotel was like a different place? Sad a we were only there 1 night?
plus^There is everything in the hotel , Awesome pool  Clean and big rooms  Good cassino
minus^1-The baggage staf very very very bad they are only working for tips 2-very bad chick-in  3-after 2 oclock i will pay to get in the pool (135$) for guests hotel
plus^Good service , concierge guy very efficient and honest.
minus^Parking is not free as before. No facilities for handicapped old man. Rate is quite high the week end.
plus^The checkin staff excellent
minus^No coffee maker or kettle in the room . The sign on the refrigerator in the room was offensive...was afraid to even touch anything in it as would be charged. Couldn'tput any personal items in it  To check in was ridiculous. .the lines were long..an hour at least in line...get more staff
plus^The Hotel is really class. One of the best in Vegas I'd say.  Fantastic rooms, great casino and great food. Right on the strip of course too.
minus^It's a bit pricey and I hate the 400 dollar additional block they put on your credit card.
plus^The little coffee shop just as you come out of the elevators amazing cakes and coffees. The sports bar staff were lovely and food was really good
minus^The rooms. On our second night the shower broke and it took 3 hours before someone came to check it which was 11.30 at night. We had to ring 3 times. We missed out on a night because of this. Also we were put in the wrong room on the first night that had red wine stains all over the floor of the bedroom.
minus^My wife is super picky about where we stay. We stayed here a few years ago so I knew this is where we'd stay again. Excellent customer service! Clean which is what we look for.
plus^Brand name and all facilities. When they changed the room, gave a credit of $75!
minus^Allocated a room with leaking roof (inside restroom) and waited for 3 hrs. to change the room.
plus^Absolutely nothing
minus^I'm not being a jerk. Nor am I partial to any other resort/hotel in Las Vegas.I left after only two nights of staying there. The staff treated us like crap, from the front desk when we first got there,to the Hispanic cleaning lady who kept walking in our room before checkout. I will never return to MGM Grand
plus^Room size and confort. Hotel offer all services and have a great pool. This hotel is a Monorail station that is much better than bus.
minus^Hotel services are quite expensive but still accessible compare to high end hotel on the strip. Not the best location if you prefer to be centered on the strip. Ensure to not have a room facing the airport as their is a lot of noise early in the morning with the helicopter passing near the hotel.
plus^The bed was so uncomfortable, it sunked in the middle.. The room smelled so bad and my view was the air conditioning units.. The worst hotel ever..
minus^Everything was horrible
plus^Good location. The Pub restaraunt was great!! Tip: buy your own cooler and drinks. Ice is free but one can drink from the machine will run you about $4-5 plus Walmart is a quick uber/lyft ride away.
minus^Room was okay not worth the price paid. They hit us at check in with an extra $200 of resort fees and there was a super long check in line at 10:30 at night and they refused to open more check in lines. The Tap restaraunts in the casino by the Poker lounge was very expensive with small portions and mediocre quality food. I definitely expected more for the big name this hotel has but I was impressed
plus^the pizza place in the underground was great
minus^From the second i stepped up to the counter i became displeased as they blamed our misssing reservation on booking.com and found out it was on there end just over bad place
plus^The rooms were nice and the facilities were clean
minus^The check in process took hours! And the food and drinks were much more expensive compared to similar casinos
plus^staff was nice.
minus^no microwave, no refrigerator. what kind of 4 star hotel is this? of course they have a stocked fridge of crap beer you can buy for $30 a sip.
plus^The location was excellent.  It was easy to get to the other resorts close-by and down the tram.  Less costly than some other newer hotels.
minus^The hotel is dated.  After spending a couple days at Mandalay Bay; the MGM was a let down.
plus^Vegas !
minus^We had a Tower suite, great room but anytime somebody opened or closed their door in the corridor outside our door rattled loudly. Also the entire casino is a smoky haze, you can't avoid stinking like smoke every day even if you're just passing through.
plus^Once they moved us back to our original booked room and we got everything situated, it was nice!
minus^When we arrived we had to wait for 54mins (yes I timed it) in the check-in line, they then upgraded us to a different room with 2 queen sized beds instead of king sized bed.  When we looked out our window, it was a view of the roof where people had thrown beer bottles and bra's (yes bra's) right in front of our window.
minus^We were upgraded to a stay well room for our honeymoon and given Spa access to enjoy while we were here. The room was clean and well stocked with towels and pillows.
plus^NOTHING!
minus^The room and its location were terrible - masking tape on walls in hallway. The room was dark, no light - room 3102, rust on the wall in the tub. MGM now charges parking at all of their hotels.
plus^The Cirque du solei show KA was the most incredible show my fiancee and I have ever seen. Worth every penny and more!
minus^The customer service at guest services was something you would expect at a motel 6. When we brought some serious issues about our room and how the plumbing backed up and filled our jacuzzi suite tub with feces when we turned on the jets,Yes we were in the tub when this happened and it was one of the most discusting things we had ever experienced, we were treated like outcasts! They offered another room much smaller for the same price as our Spa Suite. When i declined and suggested finding another hotel, they mgm employee than offered me a BR Suite and with quite displeasure in doing so. We heard nothing from the MGM after that!!! Both my fiancee and I work for fortune 500 company's who's primary goal is excellent customer service and both her and I were appalled by the mgm grand and it's lack of care for two newly engaged customers who spent quite a lot of money for one night. Our expectations fell quite short!
plus^Nice positioning, at the beginning of the strip, you can make nice walks from it. Nice casino
minus^The rooms from the west wing are more like a cave, rather than a hotel room. The stuff will do nothing to help, they just don't care about any issues, taking into account the number of guest they have every day. To expensive considering the prices from the other hotels, which offer much more for the same price. (ex. Mandalay which is in the same group as MGM).
plus^The resort, the view from my room.
minus^Check in line is too long, need more staff to resolve this.  Hotel needs to check the room after guest checked out, especially check the refrigerator before making charges to  customer.  We did not drink or eat anything from the fridge and still got 5 charges in the bill.
minus^I had prepaid two rooms. when I checked in I was ask to pay $100 deposit for each room and I had to pay the residency fee of $33 for each room,which I had already prepaid. Then two days later I was charged another $133 for what I don't know. Customer service stinks.
plus^Room service, house keeping was great very comfortable rooms I had.
minus^The guy that checked me in wasn't honest I reserved my room 2 or 3 weeks in advance and was told didn't have any more rooms left only 1st floor so went to another rep and was relocated with my friends on 15th floor I was very upset with that guy.
plus^The desserts in the MGM Buffet were good.
minus^The food in general in the MGM Buffet was not good, was very soggy, had not much taste and was very greasy.  Coin slot machine variety was not much. Very very long lines to check in.
minus^The room was beautiful and immaculate. The staff was amazing, especially Dominique Davis, the  Assitant Front Desk Manager- very helpful, curteous and attentive to my needs.
plus^Great facility with so many things to do
minus^Staff attitude, money hungry, everything EVERYTHING is for a charge, to receive an Amazon package they charge you!!!!!
plus^The location of the property
minus^When we arrived although the 2 rooms were prepaid.we were ask to pay additional money $133 per rooms $33 for residency tax which was collected when we prepaid the room. I was suppose to get a tower room I got a room overlooking  a roof. I'm very disappointed. $ 100 was supposed to be refunded upon check out , but my son's credit card was charged a extra $133.
plus^Nothing at all
minus^So everyone stay away from this hotel . Even if the MGM group owns half of Las Vegas , you should avoid MGM at all costs . They have what they ve called : West Wing . I called it Alcatraz . Small rooms with bathroom right on the door . Sink on the hallway , Windows that are very small , very dark rooms . If you re claustrofobic that s the room for you . That type of room is not for a 4 stars hotel is more like 2 stars ... I ve paid a lot of money aprox 200 usd / night to get a jail room .   If you don t want to waste money and holiday avoid MGM . In the grand tower the rooms are okay but who guarantees that you ll recive it ?   And booking.com it returns you only their price not the property taxes which are 30 USD per day + 12% state taxes . So be carefull when booking returns the prices don t rush to grab them .
minus^-Shower head broke off when we tried to shower. -We tried to auto check out and system broke and we had to wait almost 30 minutes to get someone to help us out. -They tout having internet service and in constantly crashed, so could not get work done. -Than tried to watch a movie that was having the same issues.  Kept buffering.  Both nights this happened. -They booked me TWICE.  So trying to get some money back.  They told us we would have to deal with you.  So now we will not use your services either.
plus^The view was amazing. Loved the king bed,didn't want to leave. Buffet had really good food. Plenty of variety. Definitely coming back.
minus^Parking was expensive. Was charged  $30 .
plus^The Front Desk Manager (over the phone) was friendly and helped fix things the best she could.
minus^Room did NOT look like the picture I viewed at all.  The check in person right off the bat was trying to upgrade me saying: Your room is very tiny and far away, would you like to upgrade to a suite that is much larger and close.  I declined.  Then hiked to our room only to find stained towels as well as agree that our room was very small and didn't look like the pictures at all.  Long story short, I didn't get great customer service at the counter during my 3 counter visits.  However, I called the front desk 3 times and received great service.
minus^Great room, super convenient on the first floor. The steak at Emirl's was one of the best I've ever had. Ka was a fantastic show, will come back for sure!
plus^I really enjoyed the pool! It was great- not too crowded and the water felt awesome!
minus^My shower took forever to get warm, then when it started to get warm it got out of control hot so I would have to keep adjusting the shower temp- Overall though my experience and happiness override the shower problem.
plus^i like how there's security on the tower walking around the hallway. also the security door on one side of the West wing, however, on the other side by Hakasan, I'm surprise that it's not secured. no card needed. it kinda defeats the purpose of having a secured door on the other end.
minus^room was too dark. the side lights by the bed are too dim. the light on the left side of the bed started off as decent light but after the 2nd night it dimmed down like the right lamp
plus^Facilities in the MGM were outstanding, you don't have to leave the hotel to enjoy Vegas. Room was brilliant, views aren't great but you're rarely in the room, constantly cleaned and refreshed rooms.  My second time in Vegas and I don't think I'll ever change hotels if I return.
minus^Bit pricey but it's Vegas.
plus^The staff was friendly and helpful.
minus^It was definitely not what I expected, nothing like the pictures that were used to represent the hotel. The room was extremely small, the bathroom did not have its own room, there was no mini fridge, no bath tub, and our window was small with the view of the hotel's roof. Besides this, the maintenance staff and maids continuously walked into our room after only knocking once! Definitely not worth what we paid for.
plus^The room was really nice, the bed was very comfortable and he overall resort was great!
minus^The hotel charged me a second time for the resort fee even though it was paid through booking.com.
plus^Great for the pool party's and lots to do in the hotel had a great stay.
minus^I was told to leave whiskey down bar I wasn't drunk I was just enjoying myself with a group of friends we got told to leave that's my only bad thing I had with the hotel.
plus^I loved the overall experience at the MGM. I  loved the pool its the 1st place I go to when I wake up in the morning. I  loved the crowd it attracts everyone gets along and seems to have a good time. I like the souvenirs I bought an MGM hoody and a MGM shot glass my 1st visit there.  I  love it.
minus^Waiting about 45 minutes to check in. And I also don't like  waiting in the long  cab lines.
plus^Location, swimming pool.
minus^Dirty towels on the ground when we received the room, called room service for more than 10m on hold, I hang of and they did not call back, room is very small and poor comparing with other hotels with less than half price.
plus^Room was clean, spacious and comfortable. Slept like a champ every night! Plus, everything was accessible at my fingertips!
minus^Did not experience a negative
minus^Service was horrible.  I reserved a king bed.  When I arrived, the person at the front desk told me that I had been upgraded to a room with 2 queen beds.  When I said that I reserved a king bed, and asked for a room with a king bed, he said that I would be up-charged for that.  I was visiting with my wife.  We did not need 2 queen beds.  We ended up just going into the room with the queen beds, as the person was ignoring my concern, as he kept on saying but you're being upgraded to a nicer room with 2 queen beds.  Also, no late check-out?  That's unusual to me.
minus^Staff was brutal, they score a zero in customer service. We waited in line for a half hour to check in.  When we got to the counter, the women was incredible rude, didn't answer simple questions (we drove and parked).  Wait staff in the casino were ridiculous, huffing and puffing because we actually said yes we would like a drink... this is your job, if you don't like it quit!
plus^Abundant hotel staff on floor and in positions taking care of the customers..very important to me!  Security was great..no key ...no elevator at night!  Maids were great!  I go 3 times a year, I try all hotels! Brittany Spears show was a true hit!
minus^The parking process was totally a joke..drive up machine issues pass then you walk and it won't take my cc card..so I check in and ask..computers are having problems..(hint..go and post a note on the machine)..So $10 new Vegas thing to self park for 24 hr. FOR ALL!  I thought the resort fee was a joke this is just as bad.  So if you want to go to Caesars but that is a different group...another ticket...so you can use the ticket in other casino family units...THE golden rule is don't go to Vegas if you don't have lots of money to spend...So I can't complain...Pay to play..old school rule..I
plus^The rooms were great and the bed extra comfortable. Jason, desk clerk was extra helpful, fun, courteous, informative, and really took car of us. Dinner at Fiamma was amazing. Pool time was over the top.
minus^Having to pay $18 a day for valet plus the usual tipping for valet workers.
plus^I loved being upgraded for free when they had sold out of the room I had originally paid for. I loved the security. You needed a room key to access some areas and there was always a guard at the elevator area that led up to the suites.
minus^Nothing at all
plus^Not much
minus^Smoke,room problem,way to far to get to the pool, the lazy river was dirty,they came and unplugged are drains in sink, tub,and toilet and made a mess on the floor,it took 4 hours to get house keeping to clean it up.
plus^Very comfortable bed
minus^Be aware, and prepared for very long check in times. I waited for over an hour. Think of airline line check in lines.  Also be ware that they will most likely put you in the 'west wing'  (the old marina motel) and then for a 25 dollar upgrade you can stay in the north wing (the netter part of the hotel). In my opinion this can be more transparent in the booking process. As the pictures are not consistent with what you get in the west wing. 
plus^the staff was nice
minus^The room was really warm even with the a/c turned down all the way.. Only 2 pillows on a king size bed  The shower got cold ..
plus^Pool is awesome! Tv checkout was convenient.
minus^Brunch buffet did not meet expectations, food service was poor and we did not know ahead of time that there wasn't traditional table service. We had to go to the bar for mimosas, etc. we would have given less of a tip if we knew this ahead of time.  Parking charges should be part of resort fee.
plus^Waited in line for 2 hours to check in at 6Pm. Got a dirty room upon checkin, room changed , keys did not work:(
minus^Breakfast buffet staff kept us on hold for 30 minutes to check if buffet can be charged to room
plus^We had a great time at the MGM grand hotel. The staff was very nice and informative. The show tickets were at a discount since we were guest at the hotel. We were lost many times in the hotel but the staff directed us to our event. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Las Vegas for the first time. SUPER VACATION.
minus^The crowd of people in the lobby.
plus^Good location, excellent value for the price.
minus^We had difficulties connecting to the wifi. Called help desk and we still had problems. The TV remote also stopped working on day 2.  Left a note w/ housekeeping and they did nothing about it. We had to plug/unplug the TV to turn it on/off and couldn't change the channel.
plus^I did like the registration staff they were very pleasent  , the standard room was spacious.  I did get use to the size of the hotel. The bellmen were very nice and helpful.the pool was nice.
minus^The housekeeping staff were not friendly, someone had a dog on the 9th floor near room 9416.  A lot of items were over priced, the food in the hotel was limited and not worth the money. I believe that the staff thinks everyone has been there which isn't true. Didn't provide any helpful hint and when u asked a question the answer were short.
plus^Location on the strip is good.
minus^Horrible check-in process. Only 2 clerks checking in over 100 guests. Took over an hour to get through the line on a Tuesday night.  Had to walk very far to get to our room.
plus^It was clean and food was nice
minus^The bed was horrible it make my back hurt and the pillows were very hard. When asked for deccent pillows was told there was nothing they could do. Very disappointed I couldnt make myself a hot tea in my room was very expensive to have to order room service up just to get a hot tea.
plus^Our room was quite nice and staff were great.
minus^There was no place that a person could sit down without buying something to drink, eat or gamble.  It didn't seem like a real hotel in that sense.
plus^Great place for a group of friends. Tons of party vibe, affordable with out compromise of facilities, as well as a great spot on the strip. Really close to Top Golf too.
minus^A nice little resort fee of $100 right at the end of the trip which people don't really know about unless you read the fine print I guess. This should be included in the room cost.
plus^what an amazing hotel! the rooms were huge! sometimes it was a bit overwhelming with so much going on, however it was also always exciting and something to do! the location is great as well as the staff! thank you for a great stay.
minus^unfortunately it took us about 45 minuets to check in, which was disgustingly long! it also took about 45 - 1 hour when ordering room service even if it was just a couple of drinks
minus^Be carefull when you book a room at price with discount or not...cause in the final the price paid there is significant higher with 30 USD per night as city tax and other 12% tax-so, finally price paid for a room is with few hundreds dollars higher
plus^The pools are lovely
minus^You now have to pay for parking, not enough coffee shops and coffee is now over $4. No more McDonalds.  Should have pool umbrellas, do they want us all to get heat stroke! Very slow check in
plus^Top golf was nice. Nice to have some nice shows right there in the hotel. Beds were comfortable.
minus^Buffet food was only fair for the price. Food court and restaurants food WAY too pricey!!! I was charged 5.00 for a 10 oz bottle of water at one of our convention activities from the bar. I hated the frig in the room with your stuff in it and the threat of a charge if you cooled anything in it. You should supply guest a frig. This was my first and last trip to Vegas. There was an adjoining room door in our room. Not sound proof. The girl next door let her alarm go off for about 45min. Annoying for sure. Had to knock on her door and ask her to turn it off. The hotel was not worth the room rates.
plus^Nothing This Was Our 40th Anniversary, We Stay MGM Forty Years Ago.
minus^Two Hours Plus To Check In Place Was Dirty  Rooms Were Dirty I Had A Broken Sink Faucet, I Reported It, I Have Pictures, Never Fixed Under Bed And Furniture Not Vaccumed
minus^I had issues sleeping due to a stiff mattress and uncomfortable pillows. I don't have back or neck issues those things just were not ment for comfort.
plus^The lady who helped us on Friday night - couldn't have been more helpful to us. After spending a 10 hour drive that day we arrived back to the hotel to discover we couldn't access our room with our key cards at 1:00am saturday morning! The lady at reception who assisted us was more than helpful and apologetic and made us feel at ease. (She had long bouncy curly hair and her name started with a Y) - she offered to provide us with a late check out but as we were travelling early the following morning she offered us two free buffets. Thank you.
minus^Staff on reception on Thursday night June 30th, 2016 was awful! Lady that checked us in could not have been more unpleasant and unwelcoming if she tried! I could not get over her (un) manners and rudeness - it wasn't a great start to our vacation and first time in vegas. Tried being as nice possible to her as we were so excited for our stay but she still continued to be extremely horrible to us and in the end it seemed like she was doing it on purpose.
minus^Pool always full. Parking is not free as it was confirmed (10-18$ per day). Impossible to reach front desk for assistance. Distances too big within hotel. All shops in hotel much more expencive than outside (Starbucks etc). Definitely not worth the money given.
plus^Amazing pool, great room rates and value for money, excellent service - will definitely be back!
minus^Long check-in line, limited 24 hour food options, location wasn't as central as the other hotels on the strip
plus^Location was great as well as the casino. Room size and size of bathroom was pretty nice.
minus^After pulling back the comforter, both beds had hair in them. Not sure if the sheets were not changed, or if the hair was embedded in the fabric, or if it was from housekeeping. All I know is that it was not hair from any of our group.
plus^The variety of restaurants
minus^The west wing is very dated, in need of some much needed tlc and a good clean. Previously stayed in the grand tower & is like a different hotel!
plus^The lady who cleaned my room was very nice and she did her best trying to do my room faster. It was not her fault.
minus^My room was not ready at 5:00 Pm after my check in. I came into the room with my kids and it was dirty. I called to the room services and it took 45' to clean the room. I waited with my kids outside in the hallway seating in a dirty carpet after 9 hours of traveling from Colorado.  Also, the next morning I wanted take a shower and the water was cold, really cold.
plus^The room was very nice looking,but the beds were stiff. The fact that you have to pay a resort fee of $35 plus you have to pay to park is ridiculous. If you are hungry make sure you have lots of money a burger is $27. I don't think I will be staying here again.
minus^Hate having to pay to park and a resort fee
plus^nice room condition , clean and morden
minus^Fridge no space , no coffee machine in the hotel room. Difficult to find direction as the sign not so often to see. Waste too much time looping around inside hotel .
minus^There was a huge line at check with the line not moving. Had to wait 3 - 4 hours before we could check in (on a Tuesday). There were no compromises from the hotel for the wait. The rooms and amenities were older than expected with inaccurate photos online.
minus^The walk to the room was really long. You have to walk down a long corridor to the elevator and back up the hall for your room. The room layouts were bizarre, with the shower and toilet separate from the main room only by cloudy glass, so someone in the shower could see a shadow of someone on the toilet. And despite blasting the air, it never got very cool. For the price there were no amenities in the room.
plus^I'm struggling to come up with something positive to say. The Sports Bar was pleasant, that's about all I can think of.
minus^The whole place stinks of stake cigarette smoke. I put a bottle of water in the fridge, it was removed and the fridge was locked as a result. I was threatened with a $50 fine and charged for booze I didn't touch (refunded upon complaint).
minus^My key was di activated right after ck out luggage still in the room wait for security for 1/2 hour to open the room should let me know when checking out
plus^Location
minus^The rooms were very noisy and small, and with no windows.  The shower did not work well and we cannot even take a comfortable bath. We were thinking that MGM would not dissappointed us as the brand was good and the rate was higher than the others. But it turned out that it would be better if we choose some other ones with better value.

plus^Rooms,view. Just wonderful
minus^Room service didn't clean our room 1 day during the stay. We called downstairs and requested towels and shampoo. They came immediately with items but, still didn't clean room.
plus^Good view of the strip from room.
minus^Appalling check in - took approx 1.5 hours to check in following a long flight from the UK. Poor air conditioning & charged $25 for 4 x bottles of water in the pool complex!!!
plus^Fast check out
minus^Checking in takes forever...there's a long line waiting for us when we arrived( also noticed the long line everytime we passed through the lobby).. Took almost 2 hours just to be checked in everyone was exhausted when we finally did.Restroom was slippery and tub water took forever to drain from a shower. Room is non smoking but still smell like cigarettes
plus^The hotel has everything that you might need during your stay in Las Vegas. The staff is really helpful and polite. Hotel is located right on the strip next to other famous hotels. The hotel and rooms were clean. The pools are really great for relaxation after a long day in the Vegas heat.
minus^Wait for check in is too long. They also put us in a room that we didn't reserve. The room was on the first floor and we had a beautiful Vegas view of the dumpsters. Also, there was a staff door right next to our window that people kept opening and closing during the night. We got a different room upon our request. When we checked out, they tried to charge us about $250 more for the resort fee that was, according to booking.com, included in our price. After complaining they didn't charge us, but be careful.
plus^pool was beautiful- landscaping better than Disney! The lazy river was why we chose this hotel.
minus^Pillows!! They were the worst!! My neck hurt all trip. Could hear cars all night honking- bathroom could have been cleaner.
plus^The room was clean & beautiful.  I loved the size of the bathroom.  The bed was very comfortable, too.
minus^Check in took way too long.  Took us almost 2 hours to get into our room because, after waiting 40 minutes to get to a registrar, there was a key/room number mess up.  I booked through Expedia and was happy with quoted cost.  Disappointed to see the hotel added a (surprise) $30.00 fee.  It was still a great price, but felt deceived.
plus^Great location, cozy place, helpful staff, large casino.
minus^Check in took over an hour. Refrigerator attempted to charge us for drinks just because we picked them up (staff helped us fix this).
plus^nice hotel
minus^I took us an hour just to check in. Then on a second day our card key stopped working. It took us 40min to sort that out. Lines, lines, lines everywhere.
plus^I will never stay at the MGM again.
minus^1 hour check in.  We had to be moved into another room.  No hot water in shower in first room.  Shower flooded the entire bathroom.  Very slow response time from staff.  Rooms were not very clean and not maintained at all.
plus^The pool was great - there's free shade if you get up early and pick your spot. They charge you for rings (tubes) for the lazy river. You're not allowed to bring your own but we did - don't inflate it before hand or they'll take it off you at the entry point. You get to keep your room key, meaning you can still use the facilities on the day you check out. Top golf also looked great - a golf range game with drinks and a pool.
minus^Check in queue was crazy - took an hour, no bell boys to help with bags, and the standard rooms feel like you're sleeping in a box. The window led to the back of the bundling, meaning we had the curtain closed and the lack of light was opressive - particularly as you're in a casino most of the time. They offer you an upgrade when you check in - probably worth taking this if you can afford to, it's $30 a night.
plus^Honestly there was not much to like, is close to everything, good restaurants and that's pretty much it.
minus^The service staff stole a pair of shoes we realized about it until the day we were leaving so we could not file a complaint. Because they called management and he was the WORSE manager ever. We asked how long will it take to file the complaint and he said he didn't know. How is he even a manager. He did not apologize he didn't even feel sorry for us. When I booker the hotel I read the reviews and I saw they were pretty bad but didn't expect ever to get robbed inside the hotel, when someone is supposed to go inside to clean not to steal. Very dissapointing. Honestly try other hotels always read the reviews. But MGM is the worse one, they don't appreciate your business because they think they are too cool for you. They should just go out of business if they are too cool to actually fix problems. 
plus^Good location, friendly staff.
minus^Pools were too hot and dirty.  Wet and wild shouldn't be extra.  Alcohol is very expensive.  Got put in the west wing which was a very low walk.  Casino minimum bet too high and staff took ages to fix a machine.
plus^bed
minus^I am older traveler and everything including room was a very long distance to walk to elevators. Front desk check in was horrible and no information on hotel amenities. Felt like cattle.
minus^Clean, comfy and well appointed rooms. We upgraded to a renovated room and it was perfect. Great location on the strip and close to monorail and under ground. Beautiful pool and amenities
plus^The Lobby bar and the sweet girls serving there.
minus^The check-in took 2 hours. The longest hotel check-in line I have ever seen. They did hand out cold beers to everybody in the queue, which compensated a little.
plus^Loved the location had to pay extra for the view
minus^Room wasn't cleaned properly we noticed an almond was on the carpet by the fridge and it was there after 2 days  Sink sound like it was block and made funny gargling noise
plus^Nice rooms - great staff
minus^The rooms were a very long walk & it seems like a way to get us to pay more as we were asked several times if we would like to upgrade.  Is this a way to increase the cost of our stay?
plus^Great atmosphere in the casino hotel. Great pool area and bars/restaurants. Middle of the road in standards. You get what you pay for in Vegas. Good location on the strip. Taxi rank in front of the hotel moves very fast even when long queues.
minus^Was looking for a great suite in the hotel with several bedrooms, but just does not offer that. SHould do though.
plus^I like the bed and the room and that's it
minus^I didn't like that the non-smoking section of rooms smelled like smoke and the smell of marijuana seeped into my room and I couldn't sleep ALL NIGHT.
plus^Handy for the Monorail
minus^Too big, impersonal and a bit tatty Difficult to find anything and all routes contrived to divert you via the casino Food court was unpleasant Route from car park gave a poor introduction to the hotel Nowhere to relax Ckeck-In slow
plus^I enjoyed the restaurants and the staff members.
minus^The rooms were mediocre at best. The water pressure was terrible and the sinks smelled horrific when the water was turned on. If you wanted to refrigerate something it was an additional charge. So silly.
plus^The bed was very comfortable.It was very convenient to the sky train & airport. The restaurants had really nice food.
minus^I would have liked coffee making machine in our room. The safe was too small.A fridge in the room would be good.
plus^Good location on strip. Home to wet republic and Hakkasan night club. Comfortable rooms
minus^It was so hard just to get some cheap food/drink for the room, toiletries groceries etc. We overpaid for everything in Vegas. Too hot outside in June to venture out at all.
plus^It was so dirty. It was so crowded. It  took 1.25 hours to check in when we arrived. I stood in line at the bakery to get coffee in the am for 45 minutes and was only 1/2 through the line. So I gave up. The pool area was dirty and the chairs were in poor repair. WE did a emergency check out, at that point and checked into the Ventitian.
minus^less lines, cleaner
minus^Tried to ask for some hot water. Each flask of hot water was a ridiculous 7USD + 4USD charge to have it sent to the room. Alternative was to rent a mini boiler at USD25. Daylight robbery!
plus^Excellent services, nice staff, very nice and clean. I was very happy
minus^No refrigerator. They might add at least a small one to keep our drinks nice and cold.
plus^I missed my flight and the MGM didn't call to ask where I was or if I was ok but they still took the money out of my account for a stay that didn't attend
minus^No customer service.
plus^The Room Service was very good!  The staff were so nice, and it was an amazing room selected
minus^Not a very good view, Long line and too slow by The front desk for checking in, and no coffee maker in the rooms
plus^Room was nice, and they did not charge for parking since our reservation was made before they implemented the requirement.
minus^Check-in was a long process, be prepared for a wait.  We were in a room facing the airport and had the helicopters scream over the hotel starting at 6am.  Annoying!  The resort fee is expensive considering you pay for everything!
plus^For a place that is so large, everything is so well organized.
minus^Unfortunately, there was an hour wait to check-in, but personnel could not have been nicer, offering us water while we waited.
plus^Nothing special comes to mind.
minus^The gouging prices for water and sundries in your shops is outrageous not to mention stupid.  This hotel now attracts a clientele who's  main objective is to drink as much as possible.  There is no class to this hotel.  I will never stay here again.
plus^Room was comfortable. Good location. Friendly staff.
minus^I cannot believe there was no kettle in the room, and the fact that I had to pay to hire a kettle was appalling!
plus^Bed was comfortable, shower was very nice, roomy.  Wet Republic was fun and liked the many pools.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Comedy club was roomy and comfortable.
minus^Bathrooms were horrible!!  Absolutely no privacy in the toilet area with a partially see through door that doesn't close completely.  Bathroom sink has way too many things on it  so that you can't even see yourself to do your hair.  I had read somewhere on line that there was a topless pool and blackjack at the pool.  Neither were true.
plus^Staff very friendly Facilities clean Location Good Price for accommodations was reasonable.
minus^Restaurant food quality was sub par for price. Clubs, pools, etc geared to millennials. Bachelor and bachelorette party central. If you are looking for Club Med or Hedonism vibe this is your place. If I ever visit again, I would look to other properties for accommodations.
plus^There were many choices for restaurants and activities.
minus^It was just so very busy! But that may be the same for any hotel in Vegas at this time I supposed. Sometimes we had to wait 5-10 minutes for the elevator!
minus^The sink was clogged up. I called front desk but nobody came to fix it. Other than that, a great place to stay, in the middle of the fun. Good restaurants with plenty of choices
plus^room and pool was great.
minus^Check in line took 45 min. Then would not let my wife check in even though name was on reservations. Very short and unprofessional
plus^The MGM is a great hotel with great facilities , the location is right on the strip which is perfect 
minus^There was confusion with my original booking , it ended up taking me an hour to check in , they still had not found the original booking so they made me a walk in booking , which required a $300 security deposit . Otherwise all was fine .
plus^NOTHING
minus^THE LINEN WAS NOT CLEAN ,WAITED  1 1/2 FOR LINEN TO BE CHANGED THE TOWELS WERE DINGY, MOST STAFF WAS UNFRIENDLY . THEY NOW CHARGE FOR PARKING 10.00 DAILY ON TOP OF DAILY RESORT FEES. OVER ALL NOT PLEASED WITH MGM BRAND AT ALL
plus^Nice location, and the pool was fine, but very crowded.
minus^Room was just average far better places to stay on the strip, not enough pillows on the bed, shower faucet was broken Overall didnt like the playability in the MGM casino, had more fun gambling at other casinos.
plus^Room was comfortable and quiet
minus^Queuing to get into restaurants and the costs of those restaurants. And it wouldn't bankrupt them to let you have a coffee machine in your room!
plus^Lots of restaurant choices; easy opportunities for a novice gambler; every thing needed in close proximaty.
minus^Nothing. Everything was great. I did not win any money bit still had fun.
plus^Cafe breakfast and coffee delicious although pricey.
minus^Couple fighting in next room late into the night.  Long check in lines. Too big of a property for our taste but each staff member we encountered were nice.
minus^30 minutes in line at check in made me realize that I won't book at the MGM again in the future   As a businessman I don't want to stand in line that long to get to my room. Very disappointed.
plus^Nice room although we did pay for one of the upgraded ones.
minus^Hotel was too big (should have done our research better) and rather characterless. Although there were a variety of dining options it was quite pricey.
plus^Huge property, great for a conference. 24 hours operation.
minus^Very long check in, should be automated. Carpets everywhere, sometimes smelly. Lots of extra fees and service charges.
plus^Great pools, great room and comfort. Good standard. Huge hotel, very fun with a lot of restaurants, big casino, shops, etc.
minus^Cleaning ladies want to come in and clean all. the. time. No breakfast included but buffet offered for extra pay. Offered a room overlooking the strip but it wasnt really.
plus^The whole experience, the bed was great.
minus^The long walk to the bedroom, we had to walk down a long corridor up the lift then walk back down the corridor. Should have been a lift at the beginning.
plus^the wifi worked and its familiar as I've stayed there often. Never again though.
minus^room was tiny and off the path. Dark, low ceilings and still overpriced. they are charging paying guests for self parking??? waited an hour for check in. Shower was cold. front desk staff not welcoming.  will never stay there again.
plus^nothing anymore. Used to stay here often. at least it was familiar and the wifi worked. that is it
minus^room was tiny and off the path. Dark, low ceilings and still overpriced. they are charging paying guests for self parking??? waited an hour for check in. Shower was cold. will never stay there again.
plus^I like the tv and décor  in the room and hotel amenities.
minus^I didn't like being right across from ice machine noisy and location of the room far from elevator mile walk. The room gloomy and dark and bed wasn't that comfy.
plus^I liked the look of the hotel and the fact that you had everything there inside the hotel and a lot of venues
minus^Some prices were a little to high like Avis rental car the price was way to high also the Smoking inside the hotel.The bathroom towels were not as clean as they should be also no bathrobes inside the room
plus^It's quite despite the main lobby being loud.
minus^That I had to pay an extra 28 dollars to get in my room 2hrs before check in. I felt that was unnecessary.
plus^Great options for food and activities.
minus^The MGM was very quick to charge me for using the mini bar to keep my baby's milk cold, but when it came time to change our towels and replenish our bath soap and lotion they definitely dropped the ball. The pool restaurants and bar and river pool closed way to early.
plus^Pools are great, view was fantastic and check in staff were very accommodating. Location was great and free valet parking was very convenient.
minus^Mini bar fridge was locked and there was a $50 charge for putting personal items in it. Pool was a very long walk through the casino to get to.
plus^There wasn't one thing I could say bad stay in the west wing was really best holiday ever I will def be staying again friendly staff
minus^I love it all so nothing bad to say
minus^the hotel take 200$ extra for any expences during stay to return it after scheck out but till now thay not return any thing and look like thay tray to escape pls scheck that
plus^Convenient for Vegas attractions. Good pool complex.
minus^Overpriced, but this is to be expected in Vegas. No coffee machine in room, you are expected to buy in on-site cafes. Very busy casino, good pools, but very very busy.
plus^Location was average for the price range
minus^Lack of inclusions in room rate, no free meals or free parking. Over pricing in shops, bars & eateries. Poor form for such an inflated reputation.
plus^Convenient location to strip. Easy access to stores.
minus^Hidden charges are way more than the internet price. Shops and restaurants are very expensive. Hookers club bouncer was rude.
plus^Very clean hotel with many options for food abc drinks. Staff quick and efficient.
minus^Staff gave incorrect information for bar opening hours, no parasols at the pool
plus^the location at the end of the strip was a great starting place to see Vegas
minus^it needs a refurb,,,very dark and dingy..also room very dark,,,most people like to see a view ..not a roof top,,,
minus^Staff must've had an off weekend. Extremely poor service from the moment we arrived in valet! Had high hopes for this trip, but was ruined by unprofessional and disrespectful staff. Even the Manager failed to follow through...Would consider a different hotel from now on
plus^I liked the amenities.
minus^The room we were given was dirty when we arrived. We asked to be moved but were told that wasn't possible. The shower also leaked into the toilet area and mold was present.
plus^The room was nice, they upgraded my reservation when I arrived based on availability. It's a huge hotel that has all what you want including food, restaurants, coffee shops, casino, Hakasan too..etc  The pool is also cool!
minus^The shower wasn't working well, the water pressure was low (I didn't call for maintenance). The casino is a bit old, although it's better than many but I liked casinos in many other hotels more than that one.
minus^Didn't lend crockery and cutlery free of charge, it was a bit weird for me keeping in my past experience of travel to many top destinations across the globe.  Hot water issue in shower.
plus^The rooms were cheap comparatively. It was quiet, clean, modern and reasonably close to the strip. The casino was awesome and large.
minus^There's no fridge but the fridge-like minibar. We removed some beverages out of the minibar to put in our own beverages, and was charged in the bill. We called the customer serviced and got it refunded. (The customer service was nice though!)
plus^Location night club hakkasan and help desk staff response.
minus^No proper facilities for the amount we spent for the room It's not worth for what I paid  Only reason for me to book room is the Brand MGM but it's not upto the expectations No coffee mission atleast
minus^Needs renovation, staff was almost non-existant, man who checked us in was rude and straight-up lied about several things. For how much we paid I was incredibly disappointed.
plus^The hotel was beautiful and the staff was extremely friendly. The location is ideal it is in the middle of everything.
minus^I did find a beer cap in my recently cleaned room, ironic. If it were not for the beer cap I would have rated it a ten across
plus^Great bed, great view, wifi decent, facilities brilliant.
minus^Touching the items by the TV triggered a charge for the room service. Not sure this was obviously warned so it was annoying. Delayed our check out routine by having to query.
plus^The pool area is AMAZING!!! 5 pools total! Out of all hotels in the strip...this hotel has the BEST pool experience
minus^It would have been nice to know what restaurants were in the hotel instead of trying to search for everything. The map that was given at check-in was not helpful
plus^Bed - super comfortable Room ambiance was great Good location - start of the strip/Las Vegas Blvd
minus^Standard of toiletries should've been better
plus^Location
minus^Problem with checking out. We went out for breakfast and when we returned to get our luggage to check out, we couldn't unlock door. Found out we had been checked out earlier through the usage of the tv which we hadn't used to checkout at all. It was such an inconvenience and lack of understanding from the front desk management. It seemed that our situation was not much of importance. No explanation of how that unauthorized checkout could have happened. MGM had been recommended to us from a family memberthat visits Las Vegas on a regular basis. I won't be staying there on my next visit to Las Vegas.
plus^Rom was great.
minus^The time it took to check in was awful.  It was 630pm and there were two reps available and took at least 40 minutes to get to the counter.
plus^Liked the bed - the elevators were fast, considering all the rooms. Pool area - impressive.
minus^The cost of drinks & items at the pool or confection area were pricey, and all the extra costs added to the bill were discouraging.  We were unaware we were paying yet another $18 a day for a hohum view.
minus^Checkout on telephone was awkward. The lady said 'can't check you out since you are saying you would vacate half-an-hour later''!! This after we had settled all our bills the previous night itself!
minus^I purchased the room with the access to the night club within the hotel. When I went to the club they told me the wristbands were blacked out when I had confirmed multiple times with the hotel that it was not blacked out and that I would be able to go inside the club which I was not. I will not be staying at this hotel and will not be recommending it to anyone.
plus^Pool and gym
minus^Too cool in the hotel, all products heavily overpriced, check in in took one hour. Hotel is a bit run down, carpets are shabby and appear to be dirty.
plus^Staff was very friendly,
minus^Queueing up for check in was over one hour this is far too long. One afternoon we had no hot water, we received no compensation for this only an apology. The invoice was very complicated, difficult to understand how they calculated it. We always had the impression of being cheated. Minibar had this system: as soon as you move an item it is billed to you.  The state of the hotel is old and in desperate need for refurbishing. Carpets are old and shabby. Prices extremely high for everything, even a small bottle of water costs $4.25
plus^Whole array of entertainment on offer and so much to see at the MGM resort. Helpful staff and easy and hassle free check in and check out. It was also handy to use the monorail which you can catch from the MGM
minus^Getting around the hotel was difficult, walking from the west wing to the east wing could have taken about twenty minutes.
plus^David Copperfield magic show
minus^When the elevator didn't work , they didn't have anything to use for my baby with stroller . Just tell us to use stair or escalator . Was that make scenes ? Is that MGM hotel service style ?
plus^Nice location great view
minus^No fridge, no coffee making facilities. Really casino like focus to get as much from your pocket as possible. Need to be careful not to let them get away with it. 
plus^Great location on the strip and easy to get everywhere. This is my 2nd time staying in the mgm
minus^My first stay didnt have any room issues but this time the room was breezy with lots of wind and noise coming in through the front door - not an issue during the day but the room sounded very windy at night (I was on the 14th floor). There was an issue with the window too with wind coming in. Part of the shower was also broken. The room is a bit small and there is no mini bar in the room by default like there is with other vegas hotels (e.g palms, cosmopolitan) - which meant I had to go downstairs if I wanted anything. In future I will book elsewhere
plus^Proximity to airport and other locations.
minus^More restaurants need to be open during the day. Room is dated and musty. Bathroom wasn't cleaned well enough.
plus^The location was excellent
minus^No fridge in the room which was annoying. The glass doors in bathroom area are not fitted very well and slam shut glass on glass making a loud noise each time they close! The glass looks good in pictures but didn't work that well in practice. Also the bathroom area is the first thing you see when you walk in.
plus^Very nice room and plenty of things to keep us busy
minus^We had several incidences that would cloud our choice to choose the MGM in the future.  - We upgraded to a view of the strip, which was on the 18th floor, but was more of a view of the surrounding buildings.(felt misleading) - Wife slipped by the elevators and injured her knee. (got a wheelchair back to the room and that was about the extent of the casino's concerns with her welfare) ended up limiting us doing the zipline at Fremont which was one of the main attractions we were visitng for. - It appeared to be a big issue in requesting to have our upgrade for the room reimbursed ($70) because of our dissatisfaction. Concierge was great in scheduling the exotic car we rented in replace of going ziplining.  The hotel in itself was nice, but the service I felt was lacking. I come to Vegas quite often, but I would have to be offered some considerations to stay at the MGM Grand again.
plus^Ability for last minute accommodations.  Room was nice Staff was pleasant.
minus^Cost in room price greater than tripled from Thursday to Saturday. No room service the first day until we called after coming in that evening and clean towels/cloths were delivered after 9 pm.   A refrigerator would be nice addition to the rooms.
plus^Happy about the free parking. WiFi was great. Tons of food options inside the property
minus^The fact that I couldn't use a foreign Visa debit card to pay for my stay. So I had to take my car, look for a bank, get some cash, deposit some on a BOFA account for the deposit and pay cash at the hotel.
plus^Comfy bed and pillow Room sized good
minus^Unbelievable check-in wait.  Over an hour Poor choice of healthy eating options Long walk to room Very very expensive Water not hot enough for shaving Shower not working on arrival
plus^The hotel is very close to the airport and the room we had was quite cheap. Nothing else...
minus^The room was very spartan -- just the bare necessities! The elevators are a good long walk and valet was a bit slow.
plus^The price was excellent and the cashier named Brian who grew up in Las Vegas was very energetic and enthusiastic about the MGM property. He just wanted to make sure I had a good trip. He was awesome,
minus^My bathroom sink had some dirt on it when I arrived in the room.
plus^A fantastic hotel.good value for money.We found all staff to be Courteous,helpful and Pleasant. concierge staff were very knowledgeable.
minus^Overall a really good hotel Only downside to hotel cleanliness was length of time customers room service trollies,ice buckets, food containers etc were left before collection in corridors.
plus^Wet republic was amazing! The rooms were nice, we got the 27th Floor over looking the strip!
minus^Generally the staff were nice and friendly, the ladies working within the early morning buffet section would need to go on a personality course!
plus^Good location.
minus^No hot water for the days we were there, advised staff and they did not care only stated that there were 5000 rooms and there was nothing they could do. We were also overcharged - staff member upgraded us without our knowledge and then we had a charge on our account for it! Worth the extra money to stay at aria or somewhere with better trained staff.
plus^Near the ross store and marshalls.
minus^The attitude of front desk are bad. Services at Wolfgang puck bar are terrible! Phone in the room can not be use. The door locker in the room is broken. Bed desk hurt my knee. The glasses door of bathroom is really easy to nip feet.
plus^Not much.
minus^We came for a birthday celebration and were disappointed by the hotel. I've been several times to the MGM and this was the worst. The pool area is dirty the music is so loud the music becomes distorted as the speaker blows
plus^Although the check in took a while, the staff has been kind enough to give us a 400$ suite for the price of our 100$ room.
minus^It took long (about one hour) to check in.
plus^Our room was spacious, clean, and the refer we requested was at the room by the time we got there.  We were on the 13th floor, and had a somewhat decent view.  The fellow checking us in was very accommodating and pleasant.  Bed was very comfortable, and pillows were good.    I didn't find the smoke from the casino particularly  over powering.  And I don't like smoke :)  If we ever go back to Las Vegas, I would definitely put this hotel on my go to list.
minus^We had to wait in line to check in, atho the line went fairly quickly.  Some people in line were grumbling,  didn't particularly bother me as we were early and the very nice clerk, checked us in anyway.   Prices for food is expensive in the  restaurants, but we found the food court in the hotel to be less expensive, altho 7.50 for a bottle of beer is just outrageous ,,
plus^Value for money is excellent, even the cost to upgrade our room was super reasonable. Huge choice of bars and restaurants  Great location for seeing the other hotels  Helpful staff throughout the resort  Great and lively pool area  Rooms were a fantastic standard
minus^The queues were often long at Starbucks (despite there being 3 outlets) and the queue for the Grand Buffet every day put me off trying it
plus^Room & bed was comfortable and clean. The hotel staff were always professional and friendly. The hotel has a lot to offer and great shows/entertainment. Watched Cirque du Soleil KA show which was fantastic!
minus^Didn't have breakfast. Not even sure if it was included - but I don't think so which makes it quit expensive for what you get.  The washing basin was small and awkward. No coffee, kettle or mini bar/fridge in the room. So the price from my perspective was for a room only and not good value for money.  If the other hotel amenities are included there's not much to make you aware of what you can get complementary of your stay. As this was a business/conference trip it was practical. Carpets in the hallway looked a bit dated/dirty.
plus^Location was ideal and the fact two major nightclubs were in the hotel was a bonus for getting home! Everything else was in walking distance. A little dated in places but overall a lovely place to stay in Vegas.
minus^The room was always dark, even in the day due to posters covering the window. This was annoying as we had to hunt around to find things in dim lighting.
plus^room comfortable but no extras (no coffee maker etc). Its on the strip.
minus^Unfortunately we hated Las Vegas (we were passing through). MGM Grand is so big you have to walk miles to get from the car park to the lobby to the rooms. In the morning you have to walk miles to find a coffee.
plus^Room was comfy. Pools were fabulous. Hotel layout and signs/directions really helpful. Fabulous place to stay.
minus^Room was a little dark (probably just an issue for two women and make up!).
plus^Fight week is always a great time to go
minus^Where would you like me to start? It took me an hour to check in on arrival, and it seemed like it was always going to be downhill from that.  The MGM had my dates during my stay completely wrong, which was odd considering the trip was booked months in advance.  Once I checked in after the hour long hassle, there was women's hair in my shower, clearly something avoided by the cleaners. If that wasn't enough there was also what looked like semen on the edge of my bath tub. As you can imagine I was not pleased and reported this immediately. To my disbelief I was rewarded with a minute $75 food credit.  During my stay on the third day, My room cards stopped working because there was a remaining balance on my account, during my stay?! Since when is there a balance expected to be paid before one checks out?! I then spent an hour at the front desk trying to get cards reactivated when all I wanted to do was go to my room and sleep after an incredibly long day.  Once the cards were reactivated I was assured this wouldn't happen again. 24 hours late same thing happens. On the day of check out before I had even visited the front desk, money had been taken account from the MGM without me even checking out!  Since I've been back I've tried several times to get an itemised bill sent to my email address and still no luck! I have called twice, being cut off once, second time being told front desk will send it to me. Ive emailed the MGM, and I've tweeted that, and 9 days later I still have had nobody address my issues or deal with me. I've stayed with the MGM several times before and this is by far the WORST experience with a hotel I've ever had! It's beyond disappointing!!!
plus^Staff are excellent .rooms amazing and clean . The hotel gaming floor is top notch.
minus^Shops too expensive . Walk outside much cheaper .ur cigarettes , chocolate, water .
plus^Liked our meal at Pucks .
minus^Thought it was expensive for quite a small room ,stayed at Excaliber and Tropicana and had much bigger rooms .lots cheaper .didn't like the sink area or the tap which was hopeless .for over 300 pound for two nights was quite disappointed to be honest,thought we would treat ourselves for our last two nights but wished we had tried somewhere else .
minus^Loved it, great location and easy to get to the strip. Asked at reception for an ungrade for 15$ more a night got a room with a view on the 2erd floor :)
minus^We arrived late and all the rooms where booked. We had already made a reservation but the staff was able to accommodate us, and we even got an upgrade. It was a great experience.
plus^huge hotel, the room was clean
minus^everything was very basic, one toilet paper, one soap, nothing extra. no refrigerator. at the checkout I paid extra $30 per night + tax for it + tax for all of the bill, this was surprising and the total was higher than expected. early check in and later check out cost a lot of money.
plus^The room was great. Great pool.
minus^I did not like the up sell by the staff when we checked in. The way she implied that we needed to pay extra for a different room. The comments were that the west wing had not been refurbished like it was going to be horrible and run down. I kind of felt pressured. We declined. When we got to our room it was perfectly fine. I understand it is a tactic but didn't like it when we had already spent a lot of money to stay there.
plus^Fantastic swimming pool arena, with multiple pools, day club and water facilities. There are also many dining options so you will always find something to suit your taste.  The lounge / lobby is huge and feels almost like a shopping mall... i was there during a big boxing fight which took place at the hotel's events centre... which was a nice bonus... lots of celebrities present. The in-hotel night club...Hakkasan was superb... multiple floors and music styles. Overall, the atmosphere in the hotel was great.
minus^Having stayed at another luxury suite in a different  mega hotel in Vegas before, i think the Grand tower suite room which i booked is not as superb as i expected.... it was smaller and definitely less luxurious despite costing around the same.
plus^The location and the size of the suite and free parking.
minus^No fridge and kettle in room but for $25 a day (per item) you could have this facility!!!!!!! Jacuzzi bath was dirty!!!!! Stayed in a suite as well so found this very disappointing!!!! Parking charges are to be introduced shortly!!!!!!! The feeling of greed was my impression no one likes to be ripped off won't be staying ther again.
plus^The room was spacious and beds comfortable enough. Also there was no noise filtration between rooms, even when you heard it in the hallway
minus^There was no coffe pot in the rooms to make a pot while you get ready for the day. We called front desk to enquire why. Their ridiculous answer of too large a hotel to begin to outfit each room with one, was one for the records. We reminded them that with the hotel so big, they managed to stuff the beds, tv, washroom and expensive mini bar in each room so what  effort would it taken to have also placed a coffee pot in each while they were at it. They just want to sell you coffee at $4.95 a cup instead, instead of offering a basic creature comfort ina hotel. Bull!!  Also the hotel interior top to bottom is dark, like being in a 70's basement rec room. After seeing other brighter hotels on the strip, would definitley pass over the MGM next time.
plus^Beds were extremely comfy, can't complain about the room.
minus^They charge a $30 a day resort fee which you have to pay. Most hotels in vegas let you opt out. It's for wifi and gym but the wifi is public and any one can use it any way. It also didn't work for a few days. After that is added on we didn't pay much less than our friends paid at the Wynn and the Wynn is a lot nicer than the MGM.
plus^the staff was very nice and friendly. the hotel was clean. our room was amazing, we upgraded to a higher room and it was the best decision i ever made
minus^I have a medical condition and was told I would receive a mini fridge for free, but it never got delivered.
plus^Exceptional hotel. Staff. Facilities. Amenities. Room. Everything was top notch.
minus^While the location was still great. A bit of a walk to the main strip.
plus^Location good in proximity to other things on the strip.
minus^Sink and tub did not drain, rock hard pillows, asked housekeeping for foam pillows which never showed up. Only  2 sets of towels in the room. Disappointed with the stay compared to other times I have stayed at the MGM.
plus^The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean and stylish
minus^The staff at the buffet, all bar staff that we encountered during our stay was less than customer service oriented. Most people have lots of attitude and are unwilling to make your experience pleasant
minus^the bed was old and not comfortable at all and the accommodation for the money you spend are subpar. I've stayed in nicer rooms for more than half the price which had alot more to offer. The staff was nice though.
plus^The Whiskey Down was a great hangout spot for me with Nilo and Marcus always willing to provide great information about the area and other things to do while I was there. A big thank you to both!
minus^Nothing bad to say...had a great time!
plus^The room was spotless and spacious. the bathroom facilities were clean, large, and stylish. The bed and couch were exceedingly comfortable, and the room was surprisingly quiet, despite being in a bustling hotel/casino.
minus^A map/guide of the casino locations (restaurants, games, stores, etc.) in the room would be helpful.
plus^Pools, Gym, Restaurants (lots of) and general facilities are very good.
minus^30$ charge to use a kettle! 16$ charge to use a rubber ring and very expensive room service
plus^the suite was incredible
minus^if you move anything inside the mini bar fridge they automatically charge you through a sensor system.  you then have to queue at checkout (not use the automated system) to get these charges removed.  Very sneaky.  Not impressed!!
plus^This place has everything you need and more.  It has a well equipped gym and the stunning pools that get busy for a good reason.  The staff were very helpful, I was given a new room without hesitation after an incident.  The dining and drinking options on the main level cater to every budget and taste and you have a central location to access the strip, with the monorail right next door to head further north.  I will be staying here again in the future.
minus^Some of the convenience stores are pricey, but thats Vegas for you. Plenty of options for better priced water etc less than 0.5 mile walk.
plus^The location is great and you are closer the principal Avenue called Strip in Las Vegas. There are a lot of options of the entertainment in Hotel MGM.
minus^The hotel is older.
plus^Location was great
minus^The rooms were expensive for what you get. They were clean but nothing special.  No coffee or fridge in the room. No breakfast. It all costs extra.
plus^Friendly staff. Had an tv issue & it was addressed promptly. Clean room. The view from my room. Abundance of restrooms!
minus^Smoking allowed! Dining prices. Left the entire strip for a couple of our meals. They're implementing paid parking, hard to get in & out of garage w/all the barracades.
plus^Clean, modern room.  Lazy river is  a great time, lots of good bars and restaurants.
minus^Billing confusion over price paid at 3rd party travel website, still unresolved.
plus^Everything
minus^There were additional charges I wasn't aware of. Smoking cigarettes indoors is not done where I come from. I found this takes away from the prestigious image.
plus^The pool is nice and there are lots of restaurants inside the hotel to choose from.
minus^When we arrived the girl checking us in said unless we upgraded she couldn't guarantee our room would have window! We waited a couple of hours for a room higher up (11th floor instead of 2nd) and it did have a window, but she was so unhelpful and really dampened our excitement to be in Vegas. Also the hotel is right down one end of the strip, not central.
plus^Old, dirty, not worth the money! The only good thing is the location! if I did it again I would stay at New York
minus^It was noisy beside us and the planes were noisy overhead
plus^amenities were good, lots of options
minus^the room was no frills, not even a coffee maker and the bathroom set up was odd.  water leaked out of the shower into the main area.
plus^The hotel is located close to the airport and is in a great location on the strip. Decor in the suites is modern and appeals to my tastes. Nice vibe to the place though and I will be going back but won't bother paying the premium for a suite again.
minus^The Wifi is absolutely horrendous. I did not have one video call last longer than 2 minutes, which given I was having to contact family overseas is unacceptable. It wasnt just bad wifi in the suite, it was bad everywhere in the hotel and casino and it made it extremely hard to even use uber effectively, and was even below Australian standards. I ended up paying the $5 my Australian phone provider charges I was that frustrated. Also, in the suite I stayed in the shower pressure was extremely weak. After 27.5 hours in transit to get to Vegas this was important to me so it has to be.mentioned. I  chose the suite given I was wanting to do a photoshoot while I was in LV due to the photos showing the suites having this large adjustable light which while it was in the room, it wasnt working.
plus^I loved Las Vegas, the Hotel has everything you can ever imagine and huge aswell! So luxurious! The hotel nightclub Hakasan hosts amazing DJs such as Calvin Harris, Hardwell and Tiesto! We got to meet Mike Tyson aswell and they have pool parties nearly everyday apart from the gorgeous shops and casinos 👍🏼
minus^You have to pay a lot of taxes and tips which could be quite expensive.
plus^Location was great and there is a lot available (shows, restaurants, metro stop, etc.). Very convenient!
minus^The makeup of the rooms was very late (after 4pm everyday) and it was never impeccable (no vacuum, less towels every day, etc.)
plus^The hotel is in a good location and it is a good deal for what I paid.
minus^The room was so dark and could not get to the window to let light in. Didn't like that you walk right into the bathroom. Also, it was very noisy between hall conversations and outside construction.
plus^Service employees great.  Bed firm, shower wonderful. Rooms seem soundproofed and was ventilated well.
minus^$30 resort fee killed discount; obscene prices for all things. Stains on room carpet, window blind. Room service started before 8am. Room hundreds of yards away from lobby/check in.
plus^-Really liked the Room Service: Asked for extra towels...received them. -Asked for meals...ALL WERE EXCELLENT --WARM AND DELICIOUS. -I was sick / ordered bowls of chicken soup...DELICIOUS.  Very skimpy, though, on the second bowl ordered.  -ALL STAFF WAS TREMENDOUSLY KIND
minus^Apr. 24-Apr. 26:  Room 2-535 was pitiful... -Room did not have a view -Situated by back wall that is supposed to buffer street sound. -Smelled food / meat being cooked  -Glass toilet & shower doors were heavy and difficult to prevent from banging. -Toilet seat cover could for a few dollars more perhaps be self lowering and thus quiet -ACCOUSTICS OF ROOM WERE TERRIBLE! ***Heard every single sound outside of the room and two adjoing rooms***  >>>This tower definitely needs some TLC. For all the money the hotel / casino must bring in...the hallways are dirty, the carpeting is dated and atrocious, the decor really is lacking... What is the theme supposed to be?<<< Definitely would not recommend this tower until it is updated.   Will have to suggest to my franchise company Corporate NOT TO consider this hotel for convention as they did in the early 2000's. ~~~ Sister stayed in Room #5-558...room condition was disappointing.  -Room is supposed to be ACCESSIBLE -Shade could not be lowered as cord was broken -Motor scooter was not possible to enter / exit without assistance as door needed door stop -Radio was not operable -Closet light flickered for the duration of our stay even though it was fixed

plus^Atmosphere, always inviting
minus^smoking, one sink bathrooms
plus^Staff
minus^Rainforest Cafe gone!
minus^The rooms wwre great and up to date
minus^The room was not cleaned thoroughly upon our arrival. Prior guest flossing pic was behind the bathroom door. Significant amount of dust accumulated around the furniture. Cleaning of the room while occupied was excellent
plus^The front desk staff is wonderful and very helpful.
minus^The accommodations and the housekeeping were lacking. The casino is one of the smokiest on the strip.
plus^Location is very good
minus^The room. It had an open washbasin with no provision to lock the bathroom or the WC doors. The moment you open the door you are welcomed with a sight of an open wash basin which is really funny. No provision for coffee or hot water. I stayed in a 3 star property before this and it was much more convenient.
plus^One of the best location. Have a lot of shows, very convenient.
minus^room is old, but it's very clean. MGM keeps me staying at casino. You know, this is  Vegas By the way, buffet is not delicious. Even Wynn's. Chinese town is amazing.
minus^Upon arrival, I was asked if I would like to stay at another hotel instead? Then I was sent to a room literally a mile down the hallway.. The hallway was stained, walls were stained and room was awful! Called to complain where I was sent to another room for a additional cost!!
plus^Many options of good activities. Very good location.
minus^Costly financial mistakes of $130,  I reserved two rooms at the same price, and they charged me 80$ more on one of them, the employee was trying to convince me that Booking total amount is not including every thing, saying either I accept it or he will add another $80 on the other room! Booking team rapidly sent an email indicating the total amount. He also didn't accept the booking service team email, but called them to write off the 80$. that took me more than 2 hours to solve. Plus they charged me in my home country currency! which costs me another 50$!!!
minus^Close to airport but not close from the center of Vegas.They made an free upgrade for room so I could stay in more larger room. If someone wants to watch KA show, It's better to stay at MGM.
plus^Check in was smooth. Location was ideal.Room was spacious and we were given a room with a decent view although would have preferred a jacuzzi but they had none available. And yes we were given a free entry to the night club Hakkasan which was awesome
minus^Room did not have a coffee maker. No complimentary water bottles in the room.Onsite starbucks coffee shop over priced and water bottles sold 3 times the cost available outside.
plus^These elderly house keeping staff that greeted you every single time and wished you a pleasant stay. Absolutely loved that i could get a hot breakfast at 4am on way in from club.
minus^The pool is now closed coz of the season so it would make sense to at least include the spa as part of the resort fee.  The fee was said to cover wifi (which was always show so i kept switching to my mobile data); newspaper (how many are interested in this in vegas), boarding pass printing (was shocked they don't even print it for you,  they have dumb terminals? So the resort fee to me was a total blow.  Took long to answer guest services calls
plus^Great location at the begining of the strip, friendly and helpful staff, nice  and spacious rooms, range of restaurants, great nightclub Hakkasan, complimentary products in a bathroom
minus^Weird bathrooms - lack of privacy, feels like a public toilet a bit with gaps in between, above and underneath the door
plus^I possibly not coming back here to stay in the hotel but we enjoy the show.
minus^Very little room partially clogged sink and flickering closet light, no drawers no place to seat. Dirty and old carpet floor and dirty hall way floor etc
plus^I like the location
minus^When I was checking I'm I had a very rude person and I as for manager was rude she didn't want to see what was the problem I had
plus^Nice hotel great staff to gives all the information and the room was great.
minus^Went to a room first that was already people in had to go from the room to back to the check in desk to complain
plus^The rooms were lovely and the beds comfortable.  Very clean.
minus^The bar staff were not helpful or 'happy'  I felt like a burden.  The security staff were rude.
plus^The casino was great. The restaurants were amazing.
minus^WE DIDNT HAVE HOT WATER. I'm not one to typically complain. But after one night I had it. I went down and they gave me a new room. Also they assigned me to the third level and I had a great view of a wall. Very disappointing and I will not be staying with you guys again.
plus^The location of the hotel - on the Strip.
minus^Room location and facilities: The room (SPA tower suite) was located on a high floor, but facing the airport (very close, you can see all the planes) and the airport noise is annoying (you can clearly hear all planes). The entrance door is flimsy – you can hear the hallway noise. The suite also has a door leading to another guest room. The room (the bathroom) was not clean – found shoeprint by the shower and interdental brush by the tub. No tea / coffee making facilities are available in the room. No curtesy water either (only for $9 per bottle – same water is available outside for less than $3). No bathrobes and slippers in the room – when we contacted the reception we were told that such facilities were only available in the ‘deluxe’ rooms. However, as we insisted, they were eventually provided. Please note that the room description on Booking.com clearly indicates bathrobes availability. And, as a room advertised as ‘SPA room’, you would expect bathrobes… Check-out: If you use a non-US credit card, ensure that you request the hotel at check-in to charge your card in USD as they may charge it in your local currency applying an exchange rate with commission.  Hotel experience: The hotel is charging a resort fee of $30/day plus taxes. We haven’t seen any resort features that are only available to hotel guests. All restaurants are very pricey. One restaurant displays normal prices, but once you are in they tell you that all portions are starter sized and you need to order 2 or 3 to eat the equivalent of a normal main course. There are many good restaurants on the Strip, outside the hotel. We attended two shows that we booked in advance. Not a good idea as there are no benefits for hotel guests and heavily discounted tickets are available locally.
plus^Fantastic value and good size room. Great choice of in hotel restaurants. Hakkasan club and CSI experience worth a visit.
minus^Hotel tried to charge an additional $35 for third person in room despite booking.com rate based on this. Took it off the bill after complaint.Be prepared to walk or get a taxi to get to central strip.
minus^The room is confortable but do not expect amenities like frigos or coffee making machines. The food at the many restaurants around the lobby are very, very expensive!!!
plus^Good atmosphere, (some) friendly staff.
minus^The pool was closed for the season, which really disappointed us as it was such a drawcard when we booked. When we asked a staff member about it she laughed and said 'but no one is on vacation anymore' well we were! Also upon arrival there were no more of the 'room type' that we booked so we were downgraded for the night.
plus^I really liked the fact that it had one of the hottest clubs in town (Hakkasan), food dining/restaurants were delicious-we loved everything we ordered, and it was located in a very convenient area for us.
minus^When we first arrived, I noticed that there were multiple trimmed strands of hair against one corner of the bathroom, it made me wonder if it was thoroughly cleaned. The lighting was awful. We had to turn on all the lights in order to make it bright enough to see, or leave the bathroom light on because it had the brightest light.
minus^Service is terrible ! I had a toddler and 4 bags with me, no staff at the entrance assisted me upon arrival. When I asked for some hotwater to prepare BABY FORMULA at night, I was advised it is US$12 a pot and need to wait for about an hour.
plus^Great location and the room was very nice and comfortable (except carpet).  Very comfortable bed.  Liked being on the 14th floor.
minus^If I have to note something: the carpet in room could have been cleaner. It was stained in many spots but not to the point where we were not comfortable stepping on it.
plus^The staff assisted me greatly by offering a room near the check-in counter and near the elevator. I didn't have to walk far, as its sometimes difficult for me. They were very accommodating and friendly, took care of my every need. The room service was fast and tasty with descent pricing.
minus^No bad experiences whatsoever.
plus^The location was excellent.
minus^The WiFi was useless. I questioned why it wasn't working and was told it was my phone. I walked over to a food outlet and my phone worked perfectly well on their Internet free of charge. MGM Grand did refund one day resort fee. Not good enough for six days without wi-fi.
plus^The closeness of everything.  nice clean and fresh room
minus^Bath would not empty and whilst showering you would end up with water over your ankles.  The hot water was intermittent.
plus^The hotel is well located, nice, comfortable rooms, free wifi.
minus^This was the second time that arriving to the lobby they did not find my reservation so we had to wait a lot. The self-parking is very bad anounced.
minus^The staff was sarcastic.  The room had odor and when I let the front desk know they sent someone with spray to deodorize the room.  Terrible room location.  Shady characters in hallways.  Lots of police activity.
minus^Great iconic place, loved how you came down from your room straight into the casino, monorail on site allows you easy access to the other casinos as well
plus^The room was spotless, refrig was stocked,   Outstanding view, good job MGM!
minus^Walking, it was a long trip, from room to strip, but, I needed the workout!
plus^When we checked in, our room was a mess. The bed was unmade and there was a dirty towel in the bathroom. Highly distressing after a 6 hour drive! But when I went down to reception to talk to them about it, they were apologetic and upgraded us to a better room in the Grand Tower! I also loved that Hakkasan was just a short walk away within the hotel. 
minus^We wanted a knife to rip open a suitcase since the lock code wasn't working. Room service couldnt help, and said that they would charge for sending a steak knife and it would take around 45 mins. Lol. 
plus^I liked the view from my room.
minus^No complaints all was good. Wanted to see tiësto play but it didn't happen as he does not play till 31st December. So I'm planning to go back..
plus^Spacious rooms and bathrooms. Very well decorated and maintained. Very clean and the housekeeping is excellent. Very good Resort with a lot of attractions. Well connected to all locations.
minus^No sufficient bright Lighting in the rooms.  No centralised switches for lighting. Too low Waterflow in the showers and wash. No slippers available in the rooms.
plus^The check in line was long but moved very quickly. Great location. The king size bed was very comfortable. The bathroom mirror and lighting was perfect for doing my hair and make up.
minus^Nothing I did not like
plus^Location clearly great and lots things to do mostly gambling no suprise there!
minus^We were disappointed to realise there was a hidden surcharge of 30 dollars per day which MGM Grand call 'resort fees' we assume this is mostly parking and gambling costs but still annoyed this wasn't highlighted on hotel add. Also the team could have been better at explaining the setup with the gambling
minus^Mgmt was not accommodating, room picture was deceiving not as pictured. Rooms were in bad shape, run down, bad rooms. They were also over booked that's probably why they gave me the leftover over rooms based on price thru booking.com
plus^People are kind Location is good You can find everything in this hotel Even if the hotel is all the time really busy, rooms are quiet  Nice restaurants Huge Casino Events all the time
minus^Really busy hotel (but this can be a good way too, I guess you don't go to Las Vegas if you need a quiet stay)
minus^The staff was very friendly and helpful.  We requested a small refrigerator for storing medication, and they provided it quickly and without extra charge.  They were excellent in providing directions both within the hotel and on the Strip.  Checkout was easy, and was done on the telephone.
plus^The location was great and room was nice.
minus^We made a reservation 2 months in advance and when we went to check in, there was no room available except a smoking room and requested a non-smoking.  We had a wait to check in, and when they found is a room, we went to check into our room and the room hadn't been cleaned yet. The bed was dirty, the toilet and shower were very dirty and there was trash all over the room. We ended up getting a different room but we paid a lot of money to stay there and think that's unacceptable.
plus^We stayed in a lovely room with two very comfortable queen size beds. The room, including the bathroom were clean and offered everything we could possibly need. The hotel itself also had all kinds of facilities anyone could need (e.g. Starbucks). Bear in mind that it's a huge hotel. Walks to the rooms can be long.
minus^Two main points here: 1) the pool closed for too early and even when it was open, only parts of it were accessible to guests; this was very disappointing, especially since we had partly chosen the hotel because of the pool and were charged a 'resort fee'; 2) this may seem like a petty point to make, but $8 for a 500ml bottle of water is just not acceptable.
plus^- Convenient location, close to most of the action - Nice pool with great music - Standard rooms were nice and clean in the main tower (we changed because the West Wing was so bad) 
minus^First and foremost, the West Wing is a terrible part of this hotel, I'm surprised they still offer those rooms. After exiting the main lift, you need to walk a few hundred metres to your room. God forbid if you forget anything! It is literally like the forgotten section of the building, the rooms are not looked after (tiles were coming off in the bathroom, marks all over the walls) and you have to push your suitcases all the way there. We did complain to the service desk who could only say that it was an old section of the hotel and if we wanted to upgrade they would have to charge us. Having been to numerous hotels in the past, I had never experienced being charged if the rooms were not as they were depicted when they were booked. We then had to transfer the bags ourselves from the existing room to the new room in the main tower. Also be prepared to pay inflated priced for absolutely everything in the hotel (we paid $20 usd for 2 bottles of water and an energy drink). Overall a disappointing experience for a highly rated hotel. 
plus^The location was good .. It's central on the strip.
minus^After an 18 hour day of travel we get to the MGM .. Systems down they are doing manual check in which took almost 2 hours. Get to my room and there is more hair in the bottom of the shower than on my dog, housekeeping shows up 3 hours later at which point I was in bed. AND to finish off my 4 night stay ... We could not have a late check out as I requested at check in as our flight was only at mid night ....
plus^Nothing.
minus^Access by car poorly marked. Check in: 1 hour between finally pulling in front of main door and receiving our luggage. Too big and impersonal. Small room at the end of endless corridor. Poorly designed bathroom.
plus^Good gym, good location. In Vegas it's better to book just one day in advance, you find better offers.
minus^Overpriced, we paid almost 300$ per night but our room was in the far part of the west wing: corridor and room were cold, the furniture was basic, blowdryer had hairs on it and the air conditioning near the bed was full of dust. They wrongfully charged me about 240$ on my card and I had to go and ask for a refund.
plus^Room was clean and comfortable, hotel front desk staffs were good, reasonable pricing, and location was fine.
minus^Too long queue for check-in and check-out, lots of people. The staffs in the casino were not friendly, they were like cops, so impolite. The food of a restaurant in the hotel was not good and expensive, not enough value for the money. But staffs there were so friendly.
plus^place is well located and on the strip with a good number of onsite entertainment
minus^rooms were not like what they looked, though i booed several weeks in advance i had to wait till 3pm to checkin, whereas my frieds who booked a day before me got to check in at 1pm. also i booked earlier and got a much higher price and they got a better deal though they booked at the last minute.
plus^Location Project Pie The resident Cirque du Soleil show was impressive and the discounted tickets was good value for money
minus^Housekeeping could have been better, with stray hairs and marked sheets. The premium rates for part of the stay (possibly due to a convention) meant it wasn't, in my opinion, good value for money.
plus^We upgraded rooms for a very minor charge and had a nice view of the race venue we attended. The staff were friendly and the stay was overall pleasant!
minus^Smoke in the casino but it's expected.
plus^Very comfortable. big bed. Lovely and friendly staff. Best slot machines in the casino (Ellen DeGeneres and Walking Dead). Convinent location. Big and spacious hotel
minus^smoking in the casino.
plus^Madonna was performing at the MGM Arena and it was convenient for us to stay at the MGM hotel that one night.
minus^We paid almost $400 for a room with an old bathroom with a few cheap toiletries, a really dirty carpet (suspicious stain of vomit), no view at all and it was freezing during the night. We turned the air conditioning off early but it felt it was on all night. We have never felt so cold in another hotel. We just wanted the morning to arrive, get up, leave and never come back. The hotel does not behave like a 4 stars hotel. They just want to deal with people quickly and they do not care for your requests.
plus^I thought the staff wer really friendly which is always important. Also we got clean towels and bedsheets everyday.
minus^Booked for a price, flew over and had to pay alot more than what was advertised. I understand tax and vat but it was quite expensive especially when our view from window was rubbish. I am a young person that was on a budget so this threw me off for entire trip.
plus^Able to get adjoining Queen rooms for group of 4 friends!  Staff and dealers very friendly!  Like the Food Court option for some quick meals/snacks.
minus^N/A for this trip Other trips:  unable to get adjoining Queen rooms for 4 travelers.
plus^Good place, upgraded our room.
minus^Made a mistake booking and had to check out at 11am the day before we were due to fly at 9.50am, they wouldnt honour us with a good price, and just said it was £300+ for half a night because of a convention, thought they should have done more.
minus^Everything!  We had a tower suite, huge room! Living room area, sleeping area and in between a huge desk with tv. Bathroom has a seperate jet stream bath and shower. Many towels and amenities present. Very clean! Very friendly staff. At check-in they were very friendly and patient.  Huge hotel, but if you follow the signs, all is easy to find. Swimmingpool is amazing. But be aware, duriing our stay, it closed at 5pm. We stayed in Oct.
plus^In the strip ..
minus^Very very poor wifi and the customer service gave me attitude and i had to hook up on my partner hot-spot. .. parking is very hard and far from rooms and always crowded .... the hotel looks old inside and the view wasn't as expected ....
plus^The room was very clean and spacious with an amazing view.  The hotel isn't short of things to do, restaurants, casino and a nightclub.
minus^The hotel is a very big place so did take us a while to get to our room and onto the strip.
plus^Very friendly staff, even during a busy time like Halloween. I read a lot that the smell of smoke would over power the lobby and although apparent, it wasn't terrible or unbearable. I really dislike eating at the same places while on vacation, but I made an exception for Wolfgang Puck and the Avenue. The rooms were very clean, and turn down service was timely. I chose a late checkout because my flight didn't leave until later that night and it was only $40 to extend the checkout until 3 pm, and they held my bag for free until I took the shuttle to the airport.
minus^I was a little confused about the fridge, $50 if you alter the inside? I just used a bucket with ice to chill and cool my essentials. There was also no microwave in the room that I was downgraded to because I had to take a later flight than I intended (double queen instead of the king Sig). I will definitely use my credit card to book the room because its going on 4 days and I still haven't received my room deposit or billing statement that I was suppose to get emailed. Nothing that wouldn't stop me from choosing MGM again, other than the fact it is at the end of the strip and if you're bringing a sexy lady who likes heels , you may reconsider walking to far for the action in the middle of the strip.
minus^Paper thin walls, you can hear every bathroom noises from the nearly rooms.. Cleaning ladys shout early morning 8:00 in the corridor.. They charged full price of the rooms plus caution even the deposit.. Definetly not a 4* level
plus^The location was great, staff are very friendly and helpful.
minus^However the value for money was poor. The room was ok but there was no mini bar in the room or even a complimentary bottle of water.
plus^Location.  We went to the MGM on our honeymoon 35 years ago.  Choose this hotel to celebrate our 35th anniversary.
minus^We had a room that did not have room darkening window coverings.  Our room faced the VERY LARGE AND GREEN MGM SIGN.  ALL night long were had the sign in our face.  Could not sleep because of the brightness of the sign!  Terrible way to celebrate our 35th anniversary!  Left the hotel at 8:00 AM...
plus^Nice hotel and room.
minus^The bed was not very comfortable.  The air conditioning did not work very well and comforter was very hot, but no other blankets were on the bed.  Room service breakfast for two cost $90 and was luke warm.  The advertised rate was $130, with all of the ridiculous fees ended up being almost $200.
plus^Standard
minus^Majority of the doors and furniture in the room broken. Nothing much working. Room not even cleaned by room service. Extremely poor. Bell desk useless also. Best to carry your own bags.
plus^Location.
minus^The Standard Room is VERY standard.  No decent bathroom.  A small sink in the bedroom and only a frosted door in front of the toilet and shower. Restaurants are ridiculously over priced and the quality of the food is poor.  I had a chicken pasta dish in Fiamma Trattoria and the chicken was awful, fatty brown pieces of chicken.  To look at the restaurant you'd think the quality of the food would be good but it isn't.  Better off going somewhere cheap, the quality of the food would be the same.
plus^I flew in from Hawaii for the Madonna concert. The staff was great at the front desk when I checked in. She offered an upgrade which I accepted and checked me in within 5 mins. The monorail is hooked right to the hotel so it is awesome to have that available
minus^There were stains on the ceiling. Looked like water damage. Was wondering about mold which I am allergic.
plus^The upgrade for the view of the strip and the location of the casino and amenities and restaurants in the casino
minus^Sheets needed to be changed the one day which were obviously dirty and they were not and one of the towels had a stain on the towel
plus^Ate at the pizza restaurant and it was affordable and tasted amazing.
minus^No counter space in bathroom, the room was like a mile long walk from elevators, our view from our window was a concrete wall. Paid for buffet and stood in line for over 15 mins to be seated when half the tables were empty; ended up getting refund because line never moved.
plus^The Staff was extremely friendly. 5Star
minus^I little to smokey in the Casino for our taste. Need better Ventilation. Air purifiers. But nice Casino. We smelled like a cigarette after just walking around and tona Restaurant. Didn't even gamble.
plus^Got to keep the  same room after son checked out
minus^Why they had to charge me twice resort fees 29.00 for keeping the same room I was staying in . Paid for room in advance and and then charge me  =54.00 extra for staying in the same room !
plus^It was relatively comfortable place.
minus^We didn't use Grand pool due to closing. If the hotel notified us the closing of pool, it would be better service.
plus^We only had to stay there one night.
minus^Our room was blocked in error so we couldn't get back in after returning from a show. Took staff about an hour to figure out their mistake during which time we had to walk back and forth 3 times from the lobby to our room which was located on the 12th floor at the end of a VERY LONG hallway.
plus^I liked the location and the quality of facilities.
minus^We received a warning that we would be fined for putting water bottles in the mini fridge. No one explained when we checked in that it would be necessary to rent a fridge if we wanted to keep our own drinks.
plus^Great room, great location and lots of restaurants and places to go
minus^Noise, constant music and constant smoke. My room was meticulously clean but the main area just stink of stale smoke which is especially bad in the mornings
plus^The variety of activities that take place in the hotel and its proximity to other hotels. The rooms were quiet and check in was quite fast. Its quite a busy hotel and theres so much for everyone to enjoy...old or young, singles or couples.
minus^The long hallways to the room. Anyway's its expected when the Hotel has over 5000 rooms.
plus^- excellent facilities & nice casino - no smell of cigarette, despite lots of people smoking indoors
minus^- cleanliness of room was so-so - not possible to visit MGM grand garden arena outside shows
plus^Restaurants and nightlife and convenience to the monorail
minus^Far from the other hotels, small room and not a good view.  We also had to pay extra to check in early  when they had the room available which is just another way they can make money.
plus^We stayed in the tower suite which was wonderful.  Lovely spa bath, huge comfy bed and stocked mini bar. (Bit expensive mind!)  Lovely views of the strip.
minus^Had hair and make up done in the salon for my wedding...hair was wonderful but make up was dreadful! Looked like a clown. Even though i said keep it natural. Luckily I had time to take it all off and re-apply myself, but not something you want to do on your wedding day!! Plus I paid $260 which was a total waste of money.
plus^Convenient to most places I wanted to go.  Room was generally clean and most things functioned ok.
minus^A lot of noise (room close to hub); worst was 05:30 Sunday AM when the guest next door came in and turned electronica music up so loud I thought the clock radio went off.  No physical or electronic receipt given after television checkout, and end cost on my credit card was significantly higher than the booking.com costs (including the added resort fees and taxes).
plus^Staff were lovely very helpful lifts were plentiful and quick lots of choice with food ,loved the tram from hotel meant if late out would be back at hotel in minutes, well done MGM
minus^Only thing was the continues music day and night not good if eating and wanting to chat , also paid 32.50 dollars for buffet breakfast which was not worth the money but didn't realize until later what the cost was our own fault ,won't make that mistake again.
plus^Huge venue, plenty of facilities, good restaurants, good place for young people
minus^Poor view from room. For the price you pay, I don't feel you get good value for money here. You are just a number. No perks for hotel residents ie have to pay $25 to use saunas and jacuzzis per day/charged full price to go in on-site nightclub. I have stayed in much nicer hotels with unbelievable views in Vegas for less and with all the above included and even had free upgrades. Enjoyed MGM but would stop in a previous hotel next time
plus^Location, friendly staff, comfortable bed, nice bathroom, everything was easy.
minus^Distance from the self parking to the room.  Signage from self parking to reception.
plus^the room the restaurants the pool and the gym
minus^There's not enought places to listen to music or dance besides the night club wich is too busy to even try to get in. There should be more like Mandalay bay
minus^Everything you'd want is at the MGM - food and entertainment,  you never even need to leave.  The pool was great, and Cirque de Soilel KA was one of the best shows weve ever seen.
plus^The casino was good
minus^We were very disappointed with the staff. When emptying our spa bath it bought up black water in the shower and wouldn't drain, it smelt soo bad I throw up. We went to the front desk which weren't helpful at all and wanted to change us from level 11 (nice view) to level 4, was not happy. Or they said we can stay in that room and can give us air freshner, the smell was that horrible and was unbearable and this is all they could offer oh and mind you this was all on the morning of our wedding. At this hotel you really are treated like a number, if you don't have the big bucks you are nothing to them. WOULD NEVER STAY AGAIN OR RECOMEND TO ANYONE!!
plus^I enjoyed the room, location, spa, pools, shops and attractions at the MGM. Rent a poolside cabana!
minus^I didn't like the plumbing in my room. Running water from one sink would cause foul-smelling brown water back-up in next sink. The positive was that the water would quickly drain and stench did not linger....I was given a credit on my bill for the inconvenience...
plus^Nice and must-to-see hotel
minus^I visit every year Vegas but it has been my first time in MGM. It's the worst experience that I've ever had. In the floor noisy level without external sunlight cause is covered with a plastic courtin to avoid from the outside someone can see you, like a motel but with the price of MGM! In reception doesn't give other non-smoke alternative. Indecent west wing first floor rooms as an employee told me among other things. Sorry for this words but it's how I feel.
minus^- huge hotel, everything you need under 1 roof. we didn't leave for 2 days - friendly staff and hotel guests, made friends that we will keep in touch with - reasonable prices - location was better than expected - nice casino - wet republic pool was an awesome experience
plus^customer service was excellent.from the front desk,bellhops taxi stand all great
minus^only negitive is that it is so big a ton of walking.but its vegas alot of walking is expected
plus^More or less everything available within hotel.
minus^Wifi internet in room did not work for the entire stay. Tried multiple times to call IT support who eventually escalated issue but no one called back or resolved issue.
plus^Room was large
minus^38 degrees Celsius and they had their lazy river and 2 pools closed because it was 'out of season' in early October. I don't care what season it is, if it's that hot people want to go swimming. All guest were packed in like sardines around the 2 pools that were open. Hotel is too big to have any real customer service. Room wasn't cleaned very well either, seems like cleaning staff just have too many rooms to clean and not enough time.
plus^Room is big and bed is comfy.
minus^Every night, have to wait more than 20minutes to have a hot water shower. The water was too cold to shower at first. 3 nights in a straight! The room is facing airport and above monorail, very noisy.
plus^I liked how fast they changed us from rooms when the faucet of the shower broke! The hotel front desk lady was nice and reduced my fees, for the inconvience I had experienced!
minus^The shower broke as I was taking a shower, dirty wash cloths were left in the bathroom from the previous guest! The sink was dirty! They said I would have a nice view and was left looking at the back of the hotel, when I had done an upgrade! Very long check in line seemed like you are at the airport!
plus^The bed was comfortable
minus^I didn't like the fact that even tho the hotel was near capacity they chose to only open 3 small pools and not the lazy river and the other couple of pools. The pools were uncomfortably crowded and seating was a challenge. They also only had two servers for each pool and they were run ragged. The server said there was no reason why the pools were closed. They chose to cheap out and the guests were not impressed.
plus^Big fight fan, there's quite simply no where else better to stay. For the size of the hotel, the pool area is surprisingly relaxing.
minus^Requested a room with a view, unfortunately ended up with a view of a wall.
plus^Great beds, roomy room, super clean, prompt room service, buzzy atmosphere in main area yet super quiet room
minus^Pool not open at night, but no other complaints
minus^On check in we met Lea, she was fantastic, treated us so well and was so helpful and a joy to deal with. The hotel is beautiful, well kept and perfectly operated.
plus^Nice rooms size - nice with interconnecting rooms.
minus^Placed on the strib, but in the wrong end about 2 miles from Mirage and Bellagio. Did put a fee on cleaning every day pr room at $20 excl. tax. Don't toch the refrigerator, there are scales on that will feel if you open or lift the Things in it - and then you will get a bill even if you did'nt drink anything.
plus^Room was absolutely amazing! Very luxurious, clean. Bed was amazing! Very good view of the strip.
minus^Staff at check-in wasn't very friendly. Hotel charged 30 dollars extra, we weren't informed.
plus^the location, the clean interiors of the room, albeit small
minus^the room, was in the extn-tower, which is almost like the servant quarters - the corridor walk to the lift from the room itself was about 1/2km! the check-in staff wasnt helpful with bags - i had 4 bags and had to take them all myself - made the 1km walk from the checkin desk to my room feel like 100! this is a quick way to get people into the casino, and hoping they'd spend their hard-earned dollars in the casino. you're better off in a small name hotel, instead of big-labels who have figured out how to get the most of travellers
minus^charged exceptionally high resort fee which was not mentioned at all during check in. poor room service and amenities. Not even with toothbrush and slippers. Water coming out from bathroom and I was given a room located at the same floor of the casino
plus^Nice woman at registration. Elevators and escalators. The place is huge!
minus^Need more outdoor courtyard space. Pool closed way too early. Took long time to retrieve checked luggage.
minus^Room was excellent, staff all helpful and generally just a great place to stay on the strip. 15 min walk up to Mirage/Bellagio for those wondering how far friends may be. Taxi/Uber pickups at all hotels for quicker travel.
plus^Been five times to the same hotel love the facilities within hotel and the location , wet Republic and hakkasan in the one place ... Excellent!! Take plenty money, it's Vegas 
minus^The tower block floor 21 is a night mare the very little sleep you get is extremely precious, these rooms look onto the run way, air traffic noise is ridiculous, book a west wing view and don't fall into the you have been upgraded trap like we did 
plus^Location, facilities and comfort
minus^I booked two rooms and got them in two different towers, than asked to pay additional 25$ each in order to put them together... Poor service...
minus^The room we originally booked (Presidential suite) was not available upon check in, and we were downgraded to a cheaper, smaller room. The room was still very nice, but it was a disappointment not to get the room we booked.
plus^Jerry at reception was very nice and gave us an upgrade at a good price. All the staff were friendly and the suite we had in the main tower was fanatic. Jacuzzi and bed were the best.
minus^It's pretty expensive and given the size of the place it can't help but be impersonal.
plus^Everyone was friendly. I loved the Wet Republic day party. Got a complimentary upgrade, champagne  and strawberries upon arriving.
minus^The buffet could serve more variety of food the entire week.
plus^Great location on the Strip. Competitively priced hotel.
minus^Las Vegas generally has become quite expensive compared to a few years ago, although the basic hotel price is still very competitive.
plus^MGM is the institution in Las Vegas. Been in LV 3 times, and all were in MGM. Best Value for money
minus^A bit old, did not made any improvements  for a while
plus^Nice big hotel, sport events, beginning of the strip, nice pool
minus^Room was not very clean, there were some fries left under the bed, Hotel is a little outdated
plus^The Pool was wonderful and the restaurants and bars were great also the staff was nice and easy to talk to
minus^I had booked a king size bed on a upper floor called and confirmed two days prior and told them we had a late flight and would be checking in late when we arrived we got the 4th floor a view of an alley and garbage trucks at 4:30 banging then they said we could switch rooms in the morning we had to check back at 11 then 2 then 3 it took all day to switch rooms it consumed us all day this was my husbands first trip to Vegas I wanted a nice room with a nice view
plus^Hotel had nice selection of restaurants and room nice
minus^Was not able to bring alot of personal items prices for like blotte water was ridiculous  $3-$5  that's insane.
plus^Beds were comfy
minus^Got charged twice for my room and staff were so unhelpful. Could not  get wifi in the room and tech staff never rang me back about this matter.
plus^Dining good
minus^No wine glasses in room, went to order two was told a dollar each and would have to wait 35 minutes.... How is that five star?? We were in a spa suite too.... Just greedy
minus^I have tried calling your line and it is always closed when I want to get in touch with someone. I was charged over double what my email check out reported.
plus^We had a fantastic stay! Hotel is gorgeous and great location, we got a great deal also, will return for sure :)
minus^The beds were not very comfortable either were the pillows, very minor issue though.
plus^Large room with view on the city, friendly staff, very comfortable bed, easy monorail access, great pool area.
minus^Cleanliness of room should be improved, everything inside the hotel in overpriced (like all the hotels btw), location is at the border of the strip
plus^Close to the strip
minus^Room was dirty  and fire alarm went off at 5 AM  and no one knew what was going on  after  sitting outside for 10 minutes  staff finally showed up and send us back inside
plus^perfect location, spacious comfortable rooms, and the nice food court + restaurants within the hotel + the organised help we got for car rent
minus^the view from the room was not good
plus^Almost perfect.  Stayed in three hotels during our stay. Caesars. The marriot and this.  This was the best
minus^Smoking in public places.  Vegas get with the times.
minus^We stayed in a tower suite. View was amazing. Room was spacious and we loved the jacuzzi. Hotel was so clean. Loved the pool area. It's massive and the lazy river was class
plus^Everything!! Biggest and best casino on the strip. Helpful cheery hosts, best breakfast buffet, best pool service, great restaurants, especially Shibuya! Staff are so helpful and rooms are great
minus^that we didn't have more time there!
plus^Great location, fantastic experience and immaculate rooms
minus^No tea & coffee in rooms - should be standard in a hotel of this quality. No water in rooms except at a price $8.
plus^Great location at the end of the strip and the staff were very friendly and helpful.
minus^The extra cost per day is quite expensive considering you have to pay extra to do most experiences in the hotel anyway. It really gets you at $30 extra per day - not a one off payment for your trip. Half the pools weren't even open when we were there.
plus^The entertainment side, ie pool party
minus^Some staff are rude, guy checking id's on the door of hakkasan let the power go to his head. Waitresses on the casino floor not as friendly of helpful to women.
plus^We have stayed there many times before and loved it this was the first time we were disappointed. We like the pool that was about it this yr
minus^There were quit a few things wrong we had issues with horrible service in different areas of the hotel Rude staff and people telling us wrong infrmation. We also has an incident where there was water on the floor walking back to the hotel from the pool in which I hit that water and fell. When security contacted me they made me feel like I was just clumsy! They weren't caring or worried! At the time of the fall I didn't hurt but the next day when my knee was swollen and painful!
plus^Love the room, it was great.
minus^I came to vegas for the view and asked to be on a top floor, i was placed on the 9th floor and facing walls. I had NO VIEW AT ALL!! Because of that alone I will not book there again because i don't want to end up facing a wall again.
plus^Easy reach of all the sights and outside a good pool facility
minus^Broken curtains in the room meant first 24 hours without daylight. No kettle or fridge for even basic self catering. Constant music everywhere in hotel, very loud Exorbitant prices, not even displayed in many outlets......... .......we could go on.!
plus^All staff were extreamly helpful and went out of there way to help in any way they could. Room was lovely! we originally booked a double room with one bed and were kindly asked at check in if we would rather have two doubles. Exceptional service. I'm defiently looking to come back and stay here again in the near future!
minus^Would have been nice to have a chill facility in the room rather than paying $25 elsewhere to keep refrigerated goods.
plus^Hotel is amazing. Some staff were really nice but others not so nice.
minus^A lot of the staff were really rude, especially the bouncers in hakasan. Internet was pretty bad. When I rang about it I was told to expect a call to fix it but no attempt to rectify it was made so it cost me to pay for internet even though the €30 a day resort fee should cover it. As we were there for two weeks that fee was pretty high and a wast of money. The worst part though was the time the pool closed. 4,5 and 6 o clock at the weekend is way too early. No value got for €30 a day resort fee. Also for the length of time we stayed there, they should have given some form of gratituity but nothing there either. Really disappointed with the hotel services. There's more to tell but that was the just of it. Follow up by staff tho was really poor.
minus^Great location on the strip. Room was perfect, huge bathroom. Staff always friendly from front desk, casino staff, pool staff, cleaners, always pleasant and helpful. The pool area was the best I've been to, large selection of pools including an adults only area.
plus^location is good and rooms are clean and well supplied
minus^Overcharged for 40$ without any reason for room in services, for pregnant woman was granted room on smoking floor, poor front desk services
plus^Spa Bath View from Tower Suite Facilities in the hotel
minus^Plumbing was blocked in the shower and sinks on arrival. 2 of the 4 towels had black stains on them. However we did get our resort fees taken off the bill due to the above complaints
minus^Starting to look tired in the rooms, carpets wearing out and stains visible. Didn't have rooms next to each other even though we booked months in advance.
plus^The location is excellent and like all the casinos, the services are great
minus^The rooms in Grand Tower are old and outdated. The walls and doors are thin so bring your earplugs.
minus^The MGM was perfect! From when we checked on to when we checked out! As we were on honeymoon they very kindly upgraded us to a wonderful suite! Great place!
plus^We've got to the hotel for our honey moon and got the suite for free! Great staff and service!
minus^The Frigidaire did some noise. Wifi was little slow. Breakfast buffet very expensive.
plus^best most comfortable bed of any hotel I have ever stayed in. I travel a lot on business very good service really spacious, well appointed room. would definitely stay here again
minus^One problem. I got lost quit often looking for places in the hotel. You need better direction signs
plus^Amazing room, great location for the strip and 5 min drive to Fremont St. Little bit of luxury.  Free parking, just remember where you parked in the huge adjoining multi storey. Staff v friendly and helpful.
minus^Room drains clogged and backed up into bath, took us asking twice for it be seen to. However it was sorted while we were out for dinner.  Just frustrating as couldn't have a shower before going out. Looooong check in queues like an airport.
plus^The room was amazing and very clean, the bad and pillows were super comfortable. There is free parking and u can always find a parking space. The pools and the staff were excellent.
minus^That everything cost too much. Breakfast is not included and the buffet is expensive. Smoke smell in the public area( casino, pool, loby). The hotel pool was 10 min walk from the room. Lots of people in the public area.
plus^A huge hotel with lots of things to do - shows, casino, pool, etc.
minus^We ordered a king size bed room and when we arrived to check in we were told that all king size bed rooms are taken and we need to be moved to a queen size bed room.
plus^Perfect location, great hotel for events, great pool, great clubs and restaurants. Would definitely stay there again. Great staff too!!
minus^Most restaurants close early on weekends
plus^Everything available under 1 roof.  Wet Republic excellent.  Good food court and pool area
minus^Rooms and accommodation blocks rather dark and lonely but rooms are not the main event
plus^Facilities at the hotel were awesome!
minus^There was an attendant who was tasked to check Hotel key cards as you went back to your room. He only picked out who believed didn't belong and he was very rude.
plus^None
minus^Check out girl not friendly to guest.. Rude shake head of body language and flick room card to a box.. Nvr come across so rude dtaff as if i owe her esp shaking head in yhe early morning 7 am..:(
plus^Amazing hotel.  Kinda big though!
minus^All was good except for three things. 1.  No safe in the room?  2.  External spotlights on building shone through the blinds making sleep problematic.  3.  More noise than usual through the walls also didn't help with the sleep.
minus^A great variety of restaurants available, including a good choice for gluten free eaters (coeliac). On our first night we ate at an Italian restaurant, which offered a choice of gluten free bread and pasta. The second night we ate at a sushi restaurant which offered gluten free soy sauce. Gluten free toast for breakfast and cupcakes available. All of this made our stay worry-free!
plus^We like the helpful security, they have helped us to find our car in your huge parking lot. Also the room was luxurious with a lots of emphasis to details, especially the bathrooms. Our overall experience was excellent.
minus^I cannot think of anything objectionable about the facility.
minus^Staff on reception desk not pleasant or good at communicating  Dark room with a view facing a wall  Noisy guests running up and down corridor at night
plus^the location and swimming pools were very nice. good selection of restaurants
minus^we had a lot of problems with our room. our blinds were broken and when the guy fixed them they still didn't shut properly. we had to lift our door up to shut it properly. the air con didn't work to its full potential and we and no ironing board which we had to ask for
minus^Check-in line was huge and took over 45 minutes to get to front of the line.  Not much fun after a 10 hour trans-Atlantic flight.  Didn't like the fact that no coffee/tea facilities in the rooms.
minus^Everything!! Loved that we didn't even have to leave the resort because there are so many things to do and see. Shopping, eating, and entertainment all right there!! We have stayed here multiple times and every time we are extremely pleased!
plus^Great, iconic hotel at the top of the Strip! There is such a buzz in the hotel at all times of the day and night. We loved it! Hakkasan and Wet Republic being on the grounds is a massive bonus!
minus^The crowd was a bit young, the lifts were often crowded with groups noisy of students.
plus^I liked the hotel location and the things that go on in the hotel ie boxing concerts 
minus^I never liked he fact that when I booked on booking.com I was told it would be a certain price then when I got there I had to pay more and then had to leave a deposit also on top of what I already paid,everything should have been made clearer 
plus^The rooms are comfortable.
minus^The check-in line was at least 100 people long. Waling from the parking garage , waiting to check in and then trekking to the room took an hour and 20 minutes!!
plus^Good entertainment base for club/ pool party
minus^I was very disappointed with my stay in the MGM. The WiFi in the room did not work properly, most things were of an extortionate cost e.g. FedEx internet use $30 for roughly 30mins, $9 bottle of waters plus service charge if called for room service. Also, on the last morning while checking if we were going to forget anything I found a pair of men´s underwear that were not mine. Not good enough. Would not stay again.
plus^Location and convenience to where we needed to get to
minus^The first suite was awful.  We had a 6 month old baby with us.  Non-smoking room was basically a smoking room.  Both sinks were clogged up.  The sheets had stains.  We were stuck there for one night. The second suite had issues with the shower getting stuck in the on position.  Had the water running for almost 30 mins before getting fixed.  Sink drainage was slow.
plus^The rooms were comfortable but the whole experience was a bit of a let down
minus^It is clear that the management of this hotel want to spend as little money as possible on their guests and force them into the casino where possible. They close the pool at 5pm (on a few days they closed it at 3:45pm due to a private function) even though it is mid-Summer because they can't be bothered to pay lifeguards for any longer than absolutely necessary. We had cleaning staff knocking on our door before 9am on our checkout day to see if they could clean the room - unbelievable. The front desk also tried to charge me in a foreign currency so they could make a mark-up in the exchange rate. The staff in the casino are really unfriendly and it has a really sad and nasty vibe. The internet is also terrible for what is meant to be a upscale hotel. I wouldn't recommend staying here - it's bad value for money and there are much nicer and friendlier hotels on the strip.
minus^Probably not the best pool for children. All pools have constant parting around them by guests.  Yes you might say that what Vegas is about but I   Have stayed in another hotel on the strip and the pool is much better for children.  Great if you want to party mind you.
minus^Hi I was disappointed that booking.com gave me a price which was $400 less then the actual room price. I felt mislead by booking.com. The price started was not the price with this website!
plus^Location and room (interior)
minus^Everybody of our party received a free 'upgrade' of the room, we first did to pay, but after negotiation, we received it but...room in thr North Tower on the 2nd floor with very bad view and sigarette smell and a vomit smell on the hallway
plus^Great location, lively hotel, superb pool area.
minus^The cleaning staff weren't that thorough and a little mean with the toiletries. Not great service at onsite Italian restaurant.
plus^Location on strip is good, room was nice and well presented - decent for the money.
minus^Hotel is too big, service and staff are too thinly stretched. They recently changed their parking policy making large vehicles unable to use facilities - I was unaware of this and after a 10 hour drive made to park 15 minutes away and drag my own luggage through the desert heat. The hotels reaction was just to shrug and say 'not our problem, you should've read the small print'. This was the feeling I got from them for the duration - you're just another number and of little value to them unless you're a seriously high roller. I didn't like the atmosphere at the hotel and in the end only slept there - going to better places to eat and be entertained. I'd never stay here again.
plus^Various swimming pools to suit every type of person. Huge casino with every other facility on site you could want including food court.
minus^There evening buffet wasn't as good as other casinos (but still good). Location isn't the best on the strip but still very good.
plus^The bed was comfy.
minus^40 minutes wait to check in Long long walk to room No refrigerator in room Leaking shower Delayed return of deposit Over crowded
plus^Great location and comfortable room. 
minus^My bath room floor was full or hairs from the previous guest.....I Also overlooked a $32 resort fee during the booking of the room. Forgot to read the small print carefully. They actually waived the $32 when I complaint about the hairs on the floor. So that is nice. 
plus^The swimming pool area was large as there was more than 1 pool.  House keeping cleaned rooms everyday and were around most of the day if anything was needed.
minus^Walls were very thin so could hear people walking down the corridors and also here rooms next door.  So many parts to the hotel it was confusing and with so many visitors from other hotels the place gets very busy.
plus^They had all d food court downstairs n pretty much lots to do without stepping out.. loved d wet Republic..!!
minus^The crowd.. too many youths prob loads of students which is expected but not as classy as other hotels we visited..
minus^Love staying here! The rooms are spacious, comfortable, modern and have everything you could need.  We stayed for 2 days and barely left the hotel as we loved the huge selection of pools, restaurants, gambling and nightlife  we also saw the cirque du soliel show which is inside the hotel! Would stay here again with no hesitation.
plus^الموقع، نظافة الغرف، طاقم النظافة والصيانة سريعي الاستجابة، العروض والأنشطة في الفندق. Location, clean rooms, housekeeping and maintenance are very quick to respond, shows and events at the hotel.
minus^كبير جداً وبعد الغرف عن البوابة الرئيسية، المرور في الكازينو عند الخروج والدخول.  Very huge which makes the room very far away from the lobby/entrance, having to pass through the casino upon entering and leaving.
plus^The best room with the comfiest bed ever ! Location obviously amazing and the pool out of this world !
minus^Air con in room right next too bed and on all night
plus^The pool staff (especially the beautiful Kana) took wonderful care of our group.  Couldn't have been happier with the pool scene and service.
minus^Dealers were a pretty surly group.
plus^On the main strip, breakfast buffet was great!
minus^Bathroom wasn't clean on arrival, sink plug was blocked and so to the shower plug. They overfilled each time we used them.
plus^Hotel is on the strip which is great but it's at the south end so it depends what you plan to do on whether the location is great for you. The hotel room was quiet and comfortable. A decent room in the west wing for average accommodations. Not terrible but not amazing either
minus^The bed is a little bit soft for our liking but not bad. The room could have been cleaner but it was alright considering the staff have hundreds of rooms to look after. Our friends had rooms in the grand tower and they were way nicer than our west wing room. Advice is check in early so you might get an upgrade like our friends did. Our room had no view but it wasn't bad since we didn't spend a lot of time in the room.
plus^Everything was nice and nothing was below acceptable when it comes to care, service and amenities.
minus^The number of people, the length of the lines, the feeling of being just a number among thousands. The entire experience felt like a tourist trap.
plus^Location, Room interior, Entertainments
minus^Check-out experience - the attitude of the front desk clerk (a slender female with black-framed glasses, black hair, and dark skin) was not very professional. With no greeting nor word of appreciation, she just tossed me the receipt. I was speechless for a moment and she added, What else? I had been enjoying my stay until that point, but I felt like my entire experience at the hotel was totally ruined by her attitude.
plus^View Clean Spacious Bed
minus^No room in fridge to store your own drinks No coffee making facility in the room (almost every other hotel has it) Really overcrowded hard to avoid the game machines in the lobby` A lot of pools; but the nicest closed
plus^Great location with tremendous facilities
minus^The pool closed at 5pm every day yet it is daylight until 7pm with temperature still in the high 30's until then. Very frustrating for the hundreds of us who wanted to keep sunbathing! Don't go there if you want to use the pool later in the day. The cynic in me says they do this to get you back inside and gambling!!!! Not cool!
plus^The pools in the main hotel area are amazing with great staff checking if you need anything on a regular basis... Entire complex well presented and clean.
minus^Wet republic way to crowded during an event and so ridiculously expensive. Was over $100 to enter and drinks which were $20 at the hotel pool were $40 inside. Lockers costs $50. No where to sit unless you reserve VIP. Pool dirty by mid afternoon.  Initially we were placed in a room in the far west wing. It was a long walk to anywhere. The bed was sloped and was very uncomfortable. Complained and was upgraded to another room at reduced rate.
plus^Very good overall.
minus^The cigarette smoke in the casino, and some of it goes to the other parts of the hotel. Why would they let a small portion of the customers who smoke pollute the whole property?
plus^Nice big hotel with all amenities,restaurants,shows etc.Nothing to dislike,unless one prefers smaller intimate hotels,but this is Las Vegas!!
minus^The long,long lines to book in..
plus^fantastic spot, right on the Strip, huge Hotel with Clubs, Bars and everything that makes your stay in Vegas interesting. Superb big and clean rooms. Well and modern equipped. I loved it.
minus^Dont stay here if you do not like people or you search for something private.  Thats one of the biggest hotels and the lobby is full of crowd. The Resort tax is not mentioned when booking with bookin.com. Prepare for something around 20$/per night on top.
plus^Nice big room. Convenient location to airport at bottom of strip. Big casino with lots of restaurant options. Buffet is great value.
minus^Casino smells a bit, is quite outdated.
minus^If you didn't want to, you wouldn't have to leave the hotel at all. So much going on in it! Such a big hotel, and after viewing some of the other hotels on the strip, we were happy we'd chosen the MGM. Will definitely return.
minus^Had to call twice and spend 2 hours getting a correct bill. Booking.com was very helpful but MGM grand's service was TERRIBLE. Charged me an extra $150 and it took my 2 weeks to get the money back. DO NOT BOOK HERE.
plus^This is probably one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. The quality of the room and facilities were excellent.
minus^Living in the UK we are used to non smoking public areas . I guess the US needs to catch up as it makes life a whole lot more pleasant for non smokers, and encourages smokers to give it up!!
plus^Staff was wonderful and everything you need is right in the hotel. We have stayed there twice and have enjoyed it both times
minus^The room didn't have a great view and I requested one ahead of time.
plus^The room was very nice and loved the bed.the TV in the bathroom was a nice touch. And the staff at front desk helped me with a problem.  And she was very pleasant and professional.
minus^The lights in the bathroom didn't work neither did the phone. So I had too go down to the front desk
plus^The hotel is bright and clean smelling.  I am allergic to smoke but it does not bother at your hotel   Some hotels smell like perfume that has been used to cover up smoke.
minus^The only thing I could complain about is that we booked early and received a great price for our room.   I decided to stay one more night and they would not match the price, actually they doubled it.  We moved to a different hotel for the last night.  You think they would have been happy to keep us.
plus^We found the hotel was nice and clean. With a wide variety of eating places. For a large hotel it was quite easy to find your way around.
minus^Because we found it very hot outside we thought there was a lack of sunshade umbrellas around the pools.
plus^Location and pool. Housekeeping staff is very friendly and took the time to engage in conversation with my kids.
minus^Rooms are beautiful, but not very kid friendly.
plus^Rooms were fab. The upgrade we took was well worth it!
minus^Our room was not cleaned and when it was the dirty sheets we're not changed!! We had to call for our room to be cleaned! Disgrace!  Check in lines should Also be managed better!!
plus^Our stay was fantastic the rooms were great
minus^My son had some college online school work to do and could not hook up to wifi  Unfortunately these days wifi is a necessity and there seemed to be a snafu that he couldn't hook up to do his studies it left him with a poor grade
plus^Staff was very pleasant and accommodating.  Liked the buffet, the room and overall quality.
minus^Long elevator waits, almost got run down by a group of what seemed to be college students who rushed beat us in line at a cafe.
plus^The room was comfortable good size
minus^No coffee or tea facilities terrible.    We arrived to find a sexual personal item from the previous guests to our horror ! The issue was handled very well
plus^Location perfect for strip. Hotel a good mix of clientele. Good choice of restaurants, fast food, bars and even a Nightclub! Something for all ages. Room really spacious and comfortable. Everything you need and more. Good value for money.
minus^Being first time visitors to Las Vegas and new to gambling, there was no one around to show us how to bet on machines or at gaming tables..... This is probably the case in every hotel casino? We would have loved to have spent some of our holiday cash on gambling but weren't confident enough to join others at the tables.
plus^Everything
minus^Fire Alarm went off at 6am, staff weren't well informed but turned out to be false alarm. They refunded our full resort fees as compensation for early wake up.
plus^Facilities, room , bed actually we spent 2 nights at treasure island and we decided to check out as the room was bad and once we checked in we notice the big difference
minus^Check in was a nightmare
plus^Location was good. Clean, comfortable bed and good selection of TV channels.
minus^Smoking in the hotel itself is absolutely disgusting and poses a safety risk for guests and staff. Staff could be more attentive/ friendly- used their box office to book KA tickets and the person behind the desk was absolutely disinterested and disengaged- we had to repeat ourselves multiple times re: our requests as she was clearly not listening. Our room (1-515) was dark and on the ground floor- no fridge or coffee making facilities.
plus^The pool is amazing. All the facilities are well looked after and there is endless amounts to do and see. As a solo traveller it was easy and convenient to meet people.
minus^I did not experience anything bad during my stay.
plus^Large bedrooms and great pool complex
minus^No coffee making facilities in room. Had to pay 50 dollars to store own water etc in mini bar fridge. Room too dark.
plus^facilities, interior of the room, cleanliness
minus^changes made to the booking without previously informing us, found 2 half empty bottles when we entered the room
minus^Lazy river was over crowded with large groups of people just standing and drinking while being abusive to people  to people trying to float by. Lifeguards were informed and didn't respond. very poor.
plus^The location is very good
minus^There are several kind of rooms with the same price. Therefore it's up to the person you are checking in which one is gonna give you. In our occassion we got a very small room with a very small window, without fridge. Quite frustrating.
plus^Room maid was excellent - pro active in fixing things
minus^Checking in - took over an hour. After a long trans Atlantic flight that was painful. There must be a better way or process !!
minus^I did not like that there is no dress code and in the middle of the night there are random people that fight and carry on in the casino's and throughout the hotel.  Brought the whole romantic getaway down in volumns.
plus^Omg I would never ever stay in this hotel ... I reserved a king bed room and we were given a room with 2 queen beds.. We got moved 2 times the first time because one of the 2 queen beds had hairs eventually this room we were given was not properly cleaned... It was nasty..dragged our stuff down to the lobby talked to the manager which was not nice and pleasant to talk to and he gave us a room that was not clean... Seriously there we go again moving to a room with a stupid view and it was sooo noisy god I regret so much wasting my money on this hotel. 
minus^Everything!!! 
plus^Localization was very good, directly by the Strip. Room was clean and the staff very kind and helpfull. Great swimming pool.
minus^There was no fridge in the room. The distance from the receptionn desk to the room was enormous! One night our card key got broken and we had to walk the distance 3 times. When they noticed that not the card but the lock is broken, they fixed it quickly. When we paid for the room, money was blocked on our card for a long time, even after we checked out already (money was blocked for a week). The amount blocked was aditional 100% of the room prize.
minus^Service location. Atmosphere of MGM Was fantastic would definitely stay and recommend to friends and family. Discount we got at time for room and facilities was second to none. Just like to say thank you for a pleasant stay.
plus^Very friendly and professional staf.
minus^The first 2 days in Vegas I was in a very low priced 3 star motel at half an hour walking from the Strip. Besides of the location this hotel felt much better. I think the price of a small room within MGM is too high for what you get. Hotel guests at MGM are not very classy. No breakfast for this big price, no extra's like a bottle of water. So I really wonder why a room at MGM has to be so expensive.  Pool was very very crowded. Some pools are so crowded that it is impossible to swim. If there is a next time in Vegas it will definately not be MGM.
plus^Friendly staff, very good rooms, good location. Got upgraded upon arrival because of my birthday.
minus^Probable the other guests staying at the hotel but that s not the hotel s fault 
plus^Location 
minus^Excessive alcohol and smoking in the pool area. The hotel does not enforce any restriction. I am ashamed my young children and teenage cousins had to see the scenes at the pool where drunk people were yelling around like crazy - avoid this hotel if you have young children!!!! 
plus^We stayed here for a night before our flight. We don't like Vegas but there's no point factoring that into our review. So ignoring the casino etc, the room has nice modern decor and a very large comfortable bed, and a very spacious shower. There was a long check-in queue but it moved quickly. Decent restaurants, not too expensive.
minus^Room soundproofing not great, we were awoken quite early by noisy drunken neighbours in the corridor. Would prefer to have the room separated from the bathroom by a door.
plus^Great room, super clean, restaurants and pools at hotel, staff friendly
minus^only booked initially first night (80$), when we wanted to extend the 2nd night costed 290$, would have been nice if the hotel would have offered a better price (for returning/satisfied clients)
plus^Very comfortable and clean, staff all friendly and helpful.  Massive hotel, facilities very good and a fab pool area
minus^Its massive! Never seen so many people in a hotel before, as you would expect slot machines everywhere. Smoking is allowed everywhere - disgusting.
plus^the room, comfort, clean&tidy, great service
minus^our initial night costed 80$, when we wanted to extend our stay the second night nosted 290$.... bit of a difference, expensive!
plus^Absolutely horrified that the price that Booking.Com was advertising in no way reflected the true price we paid each night. 
minus^The resort fee . The price advertised by Booking.com turned out to be half the price of the room by the time taxes and resort fees were added. The resort fees added no value at all. 
plus^Very comfortable room at a good price. Also room service was cheaper than eating at the hotel so I ended up getting that bothe nights. For a burger and chips it will be about £25.
minus^Checked in and an extra fee of $39 was added for hotel facilities. This is for the use of the pool!
plus^Great location at the strip, big room and nice pool. The concierge and the people at the front desk were very friendly and helpful
minus^We got a room on the ground floor with no view. Resort fee is high. We expected more for that price. We had to queue a long time for check in. It was hard to find the entrance of the parking
minus^The young woman in the front desk was great receiving us at arrival.  Our suit was awesome the bed was so comfortable. We loved it no complaints at all
plus^We stayed on the stay well floor & it was very nice & clean.
minus^Bring it was the stay well floor it wasn't ready for us by check in, so we had to wait another 1.5hours to get into our room & we were not early for check in. So I guess it's a toss up bc the floor was nice & was clean so waiting wasn't a terrible thing for something nice.
plus^Pool area is excellent - top tip is take your lunch with you from the food court as this is much cheaper!!!  Also, iced water is free from the bar :)
minus^couple of restaurants were closed and they were the ones we picked!
plus^Well placed at good end of strip with great transport links monorail, bus service etc to other parts of strip.  Good food options Great pool choices
minus^Incredibly expensive - everywhere In the vicinity of the strip. Go just marginally outside & you can buy 4 soft drinks for the price of 1 inside the strip. Felt a little ripped off.  Lots of shows/activities which used to be free inside all the hotels are now behind closed doors & charged for. V disappointing. Not the amazing place we visited 15 years ago, won't be back 
plus^The overall atmosphere was fantastic. Vegas is such a trip. Great restaurants and pool.
minus^We had to querie the bill when we checked out as we'd been over charged for our room. Luckily I had my booking.com reservation details. Out of all the locations we stayed in the added taxes which we did expect can be very confusing compared to other U.S. Locations. It took a while to convince them but they did rectify and eventually sorted it out.  Also the pool is an amazing experience but drinking and smoking (as its Vegas) is over encouraged so it felt like you were on a club 18-30 especially with the kids.
plus^Room quality very good. Free parking. Right on the strip.
minus^Booked a deluxe king and got a view of some air conditioning ducts. Fridge is only for the mini bar.This is a huge hotel, be prepared to do a lot of walking to get any where.
plus^Extremely bad customer service. They charge your card without explaining the reason for the sundry charges. No sense of responsibility on account of the guest relationship managers.
minus^Customer Service, Unfair levies and charges
plus^The most enjoyable part of the stay were the subtle details in my suite. Upon entry I was perplexed with the spot light fixture and what purpose it had. As I be came accustomed to the room I realized it was a spot light with a light diffuser, perfect for photography (dslr selfies) and portraits. My colleagues were so caught up with the amazing results from the pictures that we did not make the pool festivities in time.
minus^I attempted to book a loft but there were none available at the time, however the front desk clerk had amazing customer service.
plus^We got to see our other friends in Las Vegas
minus^The bed had bugs, and I woke up with bite marks, and also the room was not well cleaned. The room wasn't as clean.
plus^This was my third time at mgm grand and I actually liked the hotel a lot until now... It's close to the strip, pool area is good and there are lots of excellent restaurants within the resort
minus^They gave us a room with a broken shower. After calling the front desk we were assured help by an engineer - who never showed up. After waiting for 45 minutes and calling for a second time we had to change rooms. At a hotel that easily charges a total of >500 USD for one weekend housekeeping should check for these things. We also found an old plastic bottle in one corner of the room.
plus^The staff were pleasant and very helpful.  The bed was comfortable.
minus^I wasn't certain the bed had been changed because I found a long black hair that wasn't mine the 1st day after we slept on it.  However, the staff did promptly changed it.  Also, there was  no indication that the snacks on the mini-bar had a cost attached to it.  Eight dollars for a bottle of water is a little expensive.
plus^Liked the location and variety of shops and restaurants on the floor.
minus^The excessive smoking of other guests also the smell of cannabis on our floor and around the hotel.
minus^This was the most awesome bed and pillow ever!  I had brought my own and did not even use it. I traveled with my 60+ mom and we both slept like babies!!
plus^Excellent location, easy to walk to all the action and great hotel. Always pumping night and day.
minus^Small room, no view. But I don't go to Vegas for the room!
plus^The room was good and the staff very friendly.  The MGM is a wonderful place to stay if you have the funds to get what you want
minus^The room stunk of smoke residue which did not help my asthma.  I could not get another room because I booked through a third party.  So I had to put up with the extreme smoke residue conditions.  Luckily I brought my inhalier
plus^A bathroom that I could stretch in. Wow!  Room was clean and comfortable.  Gambled and watched Ka without leaving the hotel. Definitely within walking distance of all the action. Would stay again.
minus^Don't pull anything out of the minibar unless you use it. We were charged for pulling but not using. They pulled those charges after talking to them which was cool of them.
plus^Room was clean and comfortable
minus^Waiting too long for check-in of which employees are not that attentive to help speedy check-in process. Hotel needs to put more person. Experiencing same situation at room key service area too.
plus^View from the bedroom was good
minus^had to queue for 45 minutes to check in toothbrush left over in our bathroom from previous guests no soap or bathroom products keycard stopped working buffet too expensive and quality was terrible woken up by staff despite do not disturb sign on door
plus^The location of the MGM was ok, as we easily go out onto the street and get some fresh air or some sort of cleaner air
minus^The fact that people smoked inside the casino, the elevators and all over the place.  The place had a very stale smell.  Kids walking around the casino watching people gamble and hearing people swearing. Gambling is fine, however when you have kids wondering around the place, that's just not on.  Really not a place for kids. The whole place is so over crowded it was horrible.  We will not be staying there again or recommending this place to anyone. We did not win any jackpots at all.  Machines are such a bloody ripoff...
plus^The hotel is like a shopping center. Lots of facilities inside. The rooms have a great design. If you lose your phone and the staff finds it, they do whatever they can to return it.
minus^Because the hotel is huge, it takes lots of time to get you your room if its not close to the elevator.
minus^I've been in MGM many times, but this was the worst room ever. Yes, the room was cheap, but below MGM standards. It had a terrible smell, a very noisy a/c and also lots of noises when our neighborg above was taking a shower.
plus^Good room and good hotel for the price.
minus^Hotel very close to the airport so if you have a room facing that direction you will hear planes landing and taking off. Also, the pool hours are a bit short considering this is Vegas - booze stops at 6, lazy river closes at 6 and by 7:30 everyone needs to leave the pool.
plus^Taxi line very fast! Beds extremely comfortable. Since we are a young couple we liked that the Hotel was always busy! Good location as well, we loved it connected with New York New York and other hotels!
minus^This was not a deal breaker but we didn't like the David Coperfield show.
plus^Hotel room was really nice and clean. The maid came every day and did a great job.
minus^Overpriced and quite dated. The pool area was dirty and in need of repairs. Staff seemed so focused on getting tips they actually did very little to earn them. Having been to a few others the MGM seems more smokey than most.
minus^No free refrigerator in the room. The hotel charges 50 dollars for altering the contents of the mini bar if you try to use it for your own items.
plus^I liked the room, I liked the decor, the comfort of the bed and most amenities, the cleaning staff was awesome and the food and restaurants were great.
minus^I do not like that there was no bathroom door. I felt the map of the hotel/casino was a little confusing and that the staff were not very knowledgeable in giving directions to certain meeting rooms, restaurants within the hotel, etc. we actually found short cuts on our own that would have saved us a lot of time had we had them in the beginning of our stay.
plus^The bed 
minus^The need to line up for ridiculous amounts of time to do simple things. Check in an hour plus and then after I checked in, I left my room to explore. When I got back my room key didn't work and there was no record of me checking in 4hrs earlier, time to line up again so I can gain access to my room. Hakasan the nightclub, again line up for close to an hour, get in to find out a vodka and mixer is well over $20 Way to much of a hassle to do anything there and then get charged ridiculous prices for it 
plus^The blackout shades.
minus^Problems were not resolved in a timely manner. Not able to use fridge for personal use and not able to open once after checkout even if you haven't left room yet.
plus^The room was nice and clean
minus^When I checked in, the clerk sent me to a completely wrong area at the opposite end of the property. Also, the wifi was difficult to connect to and service constantly dropped.
minus^I hated how my room was very small even tho i payed 800 $ for 3 days and it felt like im in underground jail becouse they put me in 3rd floor didnt change my room and my view was a wall
plus^We stayed only one day. Overall was great and I would absolutely come back. Very comfortable bed and easy check out.
minus^Not even a small fridge and a coffee maker.  Most of the hotel I visited has a small fridge, microwave and coffee maker.
plus^they upgraded our room to a wonderfull suite!
minus^the swimming pools had shade beds for vip's & guest who would like to pay & book them , & the unpaid ones where behind these, it was not fair to charge for swimming pool sun shade beds!
plus^I liked the size of the room. The furniture and decor was nice.
minus^The pillows were hard and the location right above the a/c units was not what I thought I'd be looking at, but I guess it could've been worse.
plus^Pool and leisure facilities
minus^Did of have a record of booking on their system, took 45 mins to check in, they ended up photocopying details as could not confirm booking as they waited on hold to unsuccessfully contact their 3rd party booking resource
plus^Affordable luxury  Wow factor of being there Great choice on offer for entertainment
minus^Really busy queued for hour just to check in Shower handle fell off
plus^Good location.
minus^Room was filthy - toilet hadn't been cleaned, bathroom floor unswept, bedsheets and towels weren't clean.  Horrendous queues everywhere - for check-in, check-out, leaving luggage with the Bell Boy upon check-out, then collecting it later.
minus^It does not look right that they advertise the rooms with a price and after you've stayed in the hotel, they charge a mandatory fee of 30+ usd per night extra. It also was a disappointment that the smallest bottle of water costs 8 usd. I will not stay again.
plus^The atmosphere was festive.  The lobby was filled with people wanting to have some fun.
minus^The hallways and rooms were below standards, the carpets were old, the rooms did not meet my expectations.  Rooms at Hilton or Marriott are far better than rooms at MGM Grand.  I paid an average of $450/night, the room did not meet my expectations.  It was a big letdown, I will never stay at the MGM Grand again.  I would rather stay in a different hotel and go to the shows at MGM Grand. There was no clear direction on how to get to the rooms.  The guest has to go through the Casino before finding the elevator to the rooms.  Elevators were so far apart, this made it very difficult to walk to the rooms.
plus^size and organisation great choice of entertainment and restaurants pool area is excellent friendly staff clean facilities
minus^Alcohol was quite expensive behind the bars. Cigarettes were overpriced on-site too. The $30 daily service charge should be incorporated into the actualy price that is originally quoted as it is quite misleading
plus^Location and hotel amenities (i.e. Restaurants and food court)
minus^The AC was not working. You had to run the shower for almost 20min before it got hot. The manager acted like she went above and beyond when she waved the resort fee.
plus^Location was great
minus^Had to queue for 2 hours to check in so ended up checking in at 3am when I arrived at 1am, they then gave me the wrong room so when I went to my room there was already someone in it who wasn't impressed that I woke them up.
plus^The staff for the most part was helpful and understanding. Room was comfortable after exhausting travels.
minus^The shower and bathroom doors couldn't close. The shower leaked leaving puddles all overy the bathroom. My final night my key cards stopped working and it took over 30 min for an employee to get there to try theirs, which didn't work. They called their boss who didn't believe them and sent another employee to test their card who's also didn't work. Finally they send a maintenance person to fix the door. So after sitting outside of my room for an hour and a half in the middle of the night when I had to be at a meeting the next morning. I call the front desk to tell them and they offer $60 refund (on my 3 night stay) and a morning wake up call at 5. This was the worst stay I've ever had at any hotel or motel and I would never stay here again.
plus^1. Centrally located 2. Free Wifi 3. Access to monorail
minus^1. Very crowded 2. Not suitable for a family with young children unless you are a party animal 3. Had to wait for more than an hour to check in
plus^Great location. A surreal place. Hakasan nightclub amazing. Wet Republic pool party amazing. We had the cheapest room but it was very high quality.
minus^Wifi was very temperamental. The place is also massive. Nearly takes 20 minutes to get from one side to other.
minus^The canceled my booking cod I was late due to delayed flight even tho I called to let them know.  service for beverages in the casino was very bad compared to others.
plus^Easy access to everything on the Las Vegas strip or stay within the hotel confines and find everything you need at varied prices. Lively, range of prices, happy
minus^The price was good but  this meant the rooms were a very very long walk. The carpets in this area were very dirty. Wifi access but difficult access to computers if you did not bring your own
plus^The bed was comfy
minus^Worst service ever experienced an hour an a half for any room service. A $10 charge to bring some glasses to the room.  The hotel is also too far from the strip centre stay at cosmopolitan, Paris, cesars or bellagio! Oh and despite paying for a strip view they couldn't provide me with one! On our honeymoon and the tried to put us in two single beds and a smoking room!!
plus^Fantastic hotel - almost a city on its own. Pools were great for the kids. Casino staff was friendly but no blackjack tables with less than 15$ limit.
minus^Checking in took an hour - the queue was long. Hotel tried to charge me 150$ more than the booking.com price on my order. Everything is very expensive - a bottle of water cost about 4.5$.
minus^First there was suppose to be one King bed but I was given 2 double beds and the lady at check in said it was 2 Queen beds. The lighting was horrible.. All the lights were dim except the bathroom. The shades didn't go up, I guess they were broke.. There was no refrigerator except the bar which I didn't use and then I got extra charges that was not specified prior to getting the room.
plus^Great location Spacious room Free wifi
minus^No complimentary water. They will charge you $50 to use the minifridge in the room that you paid a premium for The shower hot water was very finicky and hard to find the sweet spot and water pressure was pretty low
plus^Location I would like to give a rap for Henessey the Valet, excellent 
minus^It took 2 hours to check in on Sunday 2 August at 4-6pm .....the place was a madhouse and gets guests off on the wrong foot.....it was also a hot day. When it became our turn was told there was no booking, fortunately we had the Bookings.com print out for our two day stay, the clerk then proceeded to play the piano on his keyboard for 10 minutes, then Arthur made some phone calls and finally we got a key to the room. Called Maintenance as our sink plug wouldn't operate and bloke came and freed the plug so we could use basin.......said he would be back to fix the plunger but we never saw him again!!!!! 
plus^I loved that there was a lot going on at the resort and we barley needed to leave .
minus^Did not like that the lady said she would charge us 100$ for a deposit and it was actually 300$ Bc it was 100/day... When we didn't even charge anything to the rooms and when I called she said oh sorry no it's 300. And being a guest in the hotel I didn't like that we couldn't use the lazy River. There were no tubes available and we would have had to pay
plus^I was upgraded to a King room no charge. I really enjoyed the Producers Pool...this was for adults and had lap lanes. Aside from the continual music, it was relaxing and allowed me to have my daily lap swim! Room quiet and very nice! Cab line was long but moved very fast!
minus^Crazy, busy lobby...but that's Vegas!!!
minus^Extremely large , very old interiors , huge lineups for cabs , housekeeping does not clean properly. We got a room where the carpet was wet and blinds did not work and they couldn't change it for the first night.
plus^On the strip, shows in the hotel, 24 hour dining options, clean & neat large room
minus^Nothing really special about the room, parking garage a long walk, wifi not the fastest
plus^It is such a huge complex that you find almost everything.
minus^- the long check-in line and processing. hope they could introduce express check-in online. - the distance to the strip.
plus^The concert Aerosmith and being right there..For my husbands birthday..but room disaster !!!!!!!
minus^Our room had many things broken.Blinds,no hot water,pipes coming out of wall in shower,mirror in the bathroom coming off the wall, lights out in bathroom,bed sagging,tiles in entry coming up..broken grout stabbing our feet....toilet seat loose.......Diaster !!!! :(
plus^The bell hop that got our luggage and into a cab to leave was the best!  He took us to the front of the long long line!
minus^The fitness center is entirely tooooo small for the size of the facility.  I would give that an F rating.
plus^Great Location, as well as lots of fun options for the pool area's.
minus^The pillows were hard, and the room was not very clean when we checked in. There were long black hairs all over the restroom.
plus^Loved the air filter in our room  We couldn't smell smoke at all  Black out shades were great Beds were very comfortable
minus^Wifi was painfully slow  Could have used a fridge in room Without $25 charge
minus^The MGM hotel twice but this time using the West Wing rooms are really worst of the worst I have been to Vegas Hotel lost time first came the hair sokeseoneun bed too long to walk OMG
minus^Hidden costs. Namely additional guest fee, we had three in the room which we had thought we had paid up front with booking.com. Mgm were oblivious to this and wanted us to pay an additional fee. Think booking.com may also be at fault for not being more transparent. Also resort fee and tax added at end too.
plus^Big room, good bathroom, nice TV and free WiFi was working very well.
minus^Long line at the check-in (45 mins waiting). The view from the room was the worst, but we didn't really care.
plus^Location and pool
minus^Loud ventilation noices in the room. We waited 1 hr for someone to check and thay never showed up.    We waited more than 20 min to get our car from the valet service.
minus^no coffe machine in the room no complementary water in the room, we asked for three room close to each other , we end up in diffrent rows so far from each other . total disaster.
minus^my reservation for the room was not honored the way I had booked! I feel I was treated unfairly, from MGM and booking.com staff that I called to speak to customer care >> No help!
plus^Great location
minus^No fridge in room, small room, washroom with open sink right at the entrance, too much walking to get to the room, have to go through and inhale second hand smoke to get to the room
plus^Location was good and the pool area splendid. However there should be more shady places available.
minus^Even though the room price was cheapish, the resort fee and actually everything in the premises was expensive. Like 6 dollar waterbottle in the pool. The aircon was very weak and one evening there was no warm water when showering.
minus^Amazed by the expeditious check-in procedure despite hundred of new arrivals. The queue was incredibly long and coming from a-four hour drive, the last thing we would like to do is to stand in line for registration but this didn't happen. Customer service from the valet parking attendants, bellboy, registration desk is commendable. Room was clean, and amenities were excellent. 
plus^Convenient location when seeing a concert at the MGM Garden Arena, since the venue is in the same building.
minus^Crowded and packed with people. You must go down to the lobby or shopping area to get a coffee or breakfast. Bring your comfortable walking shoes, because like most places in Vegas, you need to walk a mile through shops and casinos to get anywhere.
minus^We were very satisfied with the service and the entire experience from beginning to end. We are definitely going back soon. We are and elderly couple and a lower room rate would certainly help.
plus^Our room was very spacious and clean. The casino and shops are super.
minus^Housekeeping came knocking at the door at 9AM to refill the minibar and to clean the room. Way to early!
plus^Great hotel, monorail station inside, great restaurants, ka theatre and a luxurious vibe
minus^There was a drainage problem in our room in the sink and the tub
plus^Bed was comfortable and pool was nice!
minus^No coffee maker or fridge in room, even low budget hotels give you that! Room was facing airport and you get air traffic noise very early in morning! Prices for drinks and dinners were outrageous and unreasonable!
plus^The hotel and pool atmosphere
minus^The service at check in was shocking. I presented my booking details and was checked in by a very aggressive rude member of staff who accused me of fraud and was exceptionally unhelpful. No other check in person in the States has responded in this way.
minus^Wireless sucks Our room was downstairs just beside the garbage area and all garbage man and facility noise were in our room. Garbage guys were sitting in front of our room and talking andtalking on the early morning. All standard rooms are smoking rooms!
minus^Blind in rooms was alway breaking down. Bed linen was dirty when I arrived but they cleaned them on the night. The tap was broken and a wired smell was in the toilet.
plus^Nice sized room,
minus^no fridge in room, water stopped working during stay when we wanted showers etc. Free wifi is part of the compulsory resort fee. Staff were a bit rude at times.
plus^Great location. Room nice and clean. Pools great and lots to do in the hotel complex.
minus^The absolute worst aspect was the smoking. I had thought the casino would be away from the main part of the hotel - I didn't realise that we would have to walk through all that smoke every time we went to our room, or the pool.
plus^Location.
minus^Staff that came to clean in the morning around 9ish spoke so loudly in the corridors that our sleep was interrupted. Given that we came back to our room at 3am.. This matters! Also in a hotel like MGM grand, this seems strange that staff are not trained.
plus^The facilities were nice.
minus^I didn't like that you have to walk through the smokey casino to get to anything, restaurants, shops, lobby, shows.  Ugh!  The smoke is disgusting.  I can't believe in 2015 they still allow smoking inside.
plus^The room was nice.
minus^I didn't like the all the fees charged along with the deposit, I was also lied too in regards to the cost of the rooms. I will never stay there again. Also, there are way to many drunk people walking around bumping in to others. This is totally not a place to take children.
minus^4th floor room had view of a wall and some A/C units.  Wifi in room was terrible. Room was not very clean... Non-smoking room and found cigarette butts behind nightstand when plugging my charger into outlet. Room was very dark.... Poor lighting. Safe was locked out and had to call for assistance. Refrigerator was locked and no instructions on how to access. Felt like the rooms at Harrah's which are half the cost. Poor value. Dissapointed.
plus^location is excellent, facilities are great, staff is friendly, value for money for the rate I had was excellent.
minus^the price for the breakfast was a little out of range ( particularly compared the room rate). The next time I will probably not eat in the MGM own restaurant.
plus^The hotel was big and what you would expect. It was in the middle of the strip so you could get to places easily. There were a number of pools that opened at different times, we didn't have a problem finding a sun bed
minus^There were no tea an coffee making facilities in the room and if you wanted to put anything in the fridge you had to hire a fridge rather than use the one in the room as you would be billed for moving its contents
plus^Location was excellent. So many great facilities that you didn't have to leave the place if you didn't want to. Rooms were lovely, modern and spacious. Would definitely stay again.
minus^Had a few issues connecting the WiFi a few times, but staff eventually resolved it for us. Understandable considering how busy it was. When connected, it was then fine.
minus^$300 plus a night for a 31 square meter room its just too much, Room service didnt clean up the room, and it takes 30 mins for them to deliver new towels.
plus^Lazy river. Suite was nice.
minus^We ate at one of the restaurants, Fiamma. Truly unfortunately, three in our party ordered the risotto with truffles, a specialty. So spicy, no one could finish and two didn't touch their plates very much. They comp'ed one of the plates. But other than competent appetizers, even the spaghetti with meatballs was done badly. How do you ruin that? Kind of spoiled the evening.
plus^Awesome pool area. One of the best! Gaming floor was good. 
minus^Hard to get a good nights sleep. Stayed 3 nights. First morning was woken up at 7:30am (after gambling all night until 4am) there was some work being done either above our room or in the room next door. Sounded like someone pulling data cables through the walls. Second morning I was woken up (after another night of gambling and didn't get to bed until close to 4am) by housekeeping knocking at our door (with the do not disturb sign out) trying to deliver toilet paper to the wrong room. When I said I didn't call for it the guy argued with me saying I did. He proceeded to prove to me that he had the right room. I was in 23-310. He showed me his pager and it said 23-410.   Yes, mistakes happen I can accept that. But when I told him I didn't call he should have left it at that. But he didn't. He had to argue and prove to me that he was right.   Third morning I woke to shower and the clean towels left by housekeeping the day before we NOT clean at all.  There were stains on them.  You'd think that a hotel as grand as the MGM Grand could invest in some bleach to clean towels or discard towels that are stained/old.  The room was nice, beautiful view of the strip but needs better management over the support staff in building maintenance and housekeeping. 
plus^The entrance/ reception area was immaculate. The pools were excellent. Just loved them - Staff at pool were great... Life guards Very friendly. +++++ 
minus^Rooms were Rubbish. Staff were RUDE and pretentious - their humbleness didn't come from the heart. It was just on face. Didn't mean it. I didn't feel comfortable. Tricking people with snacks in the room not telling them not to touch - but end up charging them. I found this to be crafty. TELL PEOPLE NOT TO TOUCH IF THEY DON'T WANT TO EAT AS YOU WILL CHARGE THEM. A very long walk to the pool from the rooms. Not many choices of restaurants. Need to have a Buffett. 
minus^The hotel over charged me $200., but I called and the business office is reimbursing my credit card. Had I not noticed, the over charges would not have been removed! 
plus^Room was really nice. Good tv and really clean.  Location right at the beginning of the strip, couldn't be better.  Valet parking was fine as well.
minus^The MGM is a huge hotel so make sure y have everything you need before leaving your room. The pool e.g. is an approx 10 minute walk.  Check in took some time (nothing serious) due to the enormous amount of clients.
plus^Location Pool area no of restaurants
minus^Rooms are old and lack basic facilities like fridge was given ground level room despite requesting upper storey rooms no breakfast provided and when asked th customer service was told  to check with booking.com
minus^I LOVED Alejandro who checked me in at the front desk.  His genuine desire to contribute his energy to my experience & his 5 start customer service with my credit card needs was incredible.  STAYWELL! amazing.  I'd come back for a room on 14th floor!!
plus^The room was very spacious and comfortable.  Staff very polite and helpful.   It was a very relaxed atmosphere.
minus^Food and drink were very over priced, as in Starbucks etc.  I didn't realize how big the hotel was so always trying to find my way back.
plus^Everything else was good.
minus^My room key wouldn't work and no one responded to me when I got locked out of my room I waited for half hour and eventually had to call my husband to return from his meeting to let me in.
plus^Everything was on point!! Will definitely be back!! :-)
minus^I had a great time, during my stay here!! I will definitely recommend, this hotel to all of my business partners, as well as family and friends!!! Thank you! :-)
plus^top shelf liquor served. Lost money gambling but at least played all day on $40.00. Clean and very well maintained facility.
minus^beds were uncomfortable, room was small felt like a closet, yet priced for a suite. Didn't get into our room until after 5 pm due to no clean rooms available. Bartenders not the friendliest had to wait for them to quit talking about some hot girl to get a drink. Food was outrageously priced buffet for 3 of us almost $90.00 plus tip! Crazy I spent a lot less traveling all inclusive to the Virgin Islands.
minus^With the planned function in conference area a better means of exiting the arena. Also more lunch and destinations open for a planned evant. Many eateries closed for lunch sending people to streets.
minus^beds super comfortable, manager and staff very polite and helpful, rooms and bathrooms clean, quiet,  and air conditioned. free wifi. good value for price.
plus^Customer service of the hotel staff was excellent, room was pretty good, (no refrigerator) the housekeeping service was above beyond reproach
minus^I didn't like the long lines the high prices for food in the food court and even higher prices in the restaurants... Not close to outside restaurants. Outrageous gaming fee.
plus^Service and room design
minus^Room doors have very little sound dampening (you can hear everyone outside your door).   Elevator maintenance, the Grand West wing tower needs to work on elevator problems.
plus^Everything in the one place
minus^Wifi is hit and miss throughout the facility (bedrooms, casino floor, restaurants) We made specific requests when booking which were not looked at/ignored.
plus^I like to charge my credit card for the period I have stayed in  MGM hotel only and not more
minus^I didn't like to charge my credit card without any perfect reason.
plus^The pool.... I love the pool....
minus^On the Thursday night of my stay the water went out in the building just as I was about to get in the shower to get ready to go out.  Housekeeping staff cleaned the room on Friday but I had the Do Not Disturb sign on the door on Saturday and I received a note from housekeeping telling me due to me continued need for privacy the cannot clean my room. They were just in my room the day before they didn't need to clean my rrom everyday since I was only one person in a double room.
plus^Location
minus^The noise was horrendous and relentless. I understand Vegas is a party town but to have people literally throwing parties in the room next door at 4am, with walls which seemed paper thin, wasn't my idea of fun!
plus^love the MGM great atmosphere, great location, not too many food options inside but many close by.
minus^west tower needs little updating, long walk to the casino. standard room was really small.
minus^Beautiful place, great casino such professionals, great experience. Such an amazing time, will definitely be returning wouldn't bother with another hotel, MGM has it all.
plus^Size of rooms, lots to do around the casino, shops etc
minus^really bad wifi, dropping out all the time. shouldn't really happen in a hotel like this.
minus^The rate we booked for was not the actual rate. An obligatory resort fee of $30. a night was added on, on top of the 12%tax. This changed the price per night quite sognificantly which we were not expecting.
plus^Feeling of safety throughout establishment
minus^Did a lot of  unnecessary  walking until I worked out elevators at each end of corridor.  No refrigerator in room, what is with that?
plus^We enjoyed all of it. The location is almost the heart of the strip.
minus^The service at the Wolfgang Puck restaurant was not very good. The lazy river opened at 10am which we did not know until we went to pool area. It should open with all of the great pools it has to offer.
minus^The wifi in the room would not work on my iPhone but worked on my partner's htc phone. The wifi in the rest of the hotel worked perfectly on my phone though.
plus^It's on the Vegas strip.  There is a lot of parking space.
minus^The wifi is so slow that I cannot even open my ipad.  The pillows are not soft it feels bulky on my head.  The toiletries was not changed(shampoo,conditioner,soaps).
plus^Nothing reccomends this hotel except its location.
minus^Arrived at 12.00, had to wait 3 hrs to check-in. When entering the room, the room was a mess: chewing  gum & hair on the pillow and sheets, Q-tips & nachos on the floor. Called in the housekeeper. With me present she couldn't manage to vacuum the floor properly. I had to pin point the garbage to her. All the towels were dirty and placed on the rack as clean, no cleaning of the room during our stay. No mention of hotel hidden taxes on Booking such as: MGM resort fee ($29.50/day -includes WiFi which they say it's free) and Hotel resort fee ($3.40/day). City tax is paid separately.
plus^Friendly Welcome and prefessional  assistance from the Reception Manager Alex upgrading my Room to 21 st Floor free of charg ....Good Restaurants around....Nice swiming pool ....Non stop Fun :)
minus^too many Drunk people in Floors making noises coming back to their rooms, slow Wifi in Rooms,Not having room slippers to wear keeping the Beds clean coming out of the WC ..
plus^Darla at the front desk checked us in. She is the only staff member I encountered that was was bright, engaged and knowledgeable about the hotel. 
minus^The only reason to stay here...wait....no...there isn't one. The hotel is so huge there is no way to ensure quality, so it has none. Let me just say, after crawling into bed exhausted from a cross country drive, when I awoke the next morning and pulled back the sheets, there were marks by the foot of the bed. Obviously the sheets had not been changed! Trying to get a resolve on this issue was frustrating and insulting. Suffice it to say, mgm Grand takes the hospitality out of Hospitality Industry. There are so many options in this town, unless budget or business force you to stay here....DON'T. 
plus^Staff as great... 
minus^Wifi access is a joke..3MB? Really? Then pay $15.00 a day for 5mb? On top of the 300 bucks a day for a room? Tv didn't work half the time...called 3 times and never got it fixed...in the real world you need real Wifi...not this 2001 dial up version. 
plus^Very smart and modern good vibe, busy
minus^west wing, very long walk down corridor. bathroom setup a bit strange, open plan and right by the door.  resort fees expensive for a one night stay.
minus^Friendly staff that helped change the extra room from a single to two queens on the same floor at check in. I had goofed when I booked the room on line, but the staff person was able to help us out!
plus^Clean, modern , nice staff ! Pools are quality......
minus^Check in queue was nearly 30mins , Prices inside hotel were extortion ! $6.50 for a litre of water ! 9$ bottles of beer , wifi disconnects and reconnects a lot !
plus^I was there for one night and was upgraded to a Junior Suite, which was such a treat. It was a great room and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.
minus^The shower was't hot enough, but I also prefer the water to be hotter than the average person.
plus^I liked that the hotel was busy but it was also kind of the quiet side other than most hotels. And also most of what you wanted like a buffet or Mcdonalds was already inside the hotel.
minus^Checking in at the desk had a pretty long line up. Also checking out in the morning because theres so many people checking out the same day which leads to long line ups for the taxis.
plus^This place is a huge labyrinth of quality entertainment, food, and leisure. The concierge are helpful and courteous. After the inconvenience of an unexpected water shut down in our wing, the MGM gave us a $50.00 credit which we put towards a great meal at Emeril's. The alligator meatballs are simply awesome! The casino floor is busy but if you find the right spot to throw your money away serving staff can be attentive especially if you tip them. The comedy acts at Brad Garrett's Comedy Club was worth the price of admission and the family friendly pool area is also well worth the stay.
minus^The line ups for checking in were very long. Took about 20 minutes to get to the front desk. Another negative is that this complex is simply too huge and can be overwhelming. Finding your way around the casino floor from one end of the complex to the other is confusing and frustrating at times. If you're not familiar with this place make sure you have a complex map on you until you get to know your way around the floor. Finding the elevators to the Grand Tower can be challenging after your first time out on the floor. The only other thing is that there are far too few servers on the floor for the amount of gamblers. Finding a good and attentive server is hit and miss.
plus^Maid service was excellent.  Room was very clean.  Monorail service very convenient.
minus^WiFi did not work well at all -- not even in the attached convention area for the dance competition.
plus^The staff was helpful
minus^We were a group in 4 rooms, the staff was good but when we reached our room there were hair on the floor ( in quantities ) in 3 of our 4 rooms, we asked to clean the room and they did BUT the only thing that happen is the dirt was cut in half and still the rooms were not clean at all. The corridors to the rooms are dark, long, and not appealing at all, the view of our rooms was a ZERO  Bottom line we had to cancel the reat of our stay and went back to Aria hotel and resort
plus^POOLS, casino (I still think their poker room is one of the least attractive on the strip) Room was SO nice, quick elevators, nice staff.
minus^I wouldn't bother buying their frozen drinks in the pool area, insanely expensive and I NEVER got a buzz on. In the other places I bought similar drinks, you can see the bartenders pour the liqueur in. I asked how much is in the MGM drinks and they said 4-5 shots, which I think is bull. I recommend going to Fat Tuesday in the Underground located off the lobby.
plus^Room was very clean and comfortable. Location was great and close to mono rail. Needed to use this as a walk to the bottom of the strip seemed forever in the heat.
minus^Breakfast extremely over priced. Bad odour in the hotel.
plus^Rooms were very comfortable with plenty of space for us (fabulous price deal); free WiFi worked well; staff very polite and focused on delivering good service promptly; great discount on last minute tickets to see Ka (Cirque de Soleil) which was in the building; great location - wish we'd stayed another day!
minus^Mini bar and food stores nearby were typically overpriced; ground floor with casino and access to pools and theatre were chaotic with the summer crowd; while the hotel was great, some of the guests were a little drunk and we didn't appreciate the cigarette smoke (as we had to walk through to the theatre, restaurants, exit from the elevators, etc)
plus^Comfort and quality
minus^At check-in informed that the price I had pre-paid was only for first night and second night had still to be paid for which did not tally with the way in which what I had paid for was presented on booking with Booking.com. Check-in staff were adamant that a second night still had to be paid for. There is clearly a problem here as the price quoted by Booking.com in my experience reflects the overall price.
plus^Top end, stylish hotel with a great vibe. Loads of amenities available within the hotel. Situated at the top of the strip with great access to numerous bars, restaurants and other hotels.
minus^Helicopters taking off from nearby each morning
plus^The location was good. Easy access to get the bus downtown. Loads of places to shop, eat and see. Vibrant atmosphere.
minus^The long line up to check in. Took us about 45 minutes to get hotel room keys. They need to speeden up this process! Wifi not adequate. Wasn't working for a whole day, and when we finally had to go to reception to log us on, was only available for 48hrs! So much for free! Process of logging on too tedious. Room wasn't cleaned for one day. When we complained they said we were checking out the next day! Very bad indeed!! No excuse.
plus^Hotel rooms were good size albeit dated. Pool area was excellent as was choice of food places for eating.
minus^Casino was dated and the smell of cigarette smoke is overwhelming. Pretty much impossible to get anywhere without going through a maze of casino games. Other hotels had a much better layout and were cleaner than the MGM
minus^We have requested late check-out during our stay because our flight was 9 pm. They kept telling us you have to ask in the morning of the check-out date and we will see the avilibilty (weird) even after we told them that we will pay. They checked us out 12 pm and we had to stay moving around in vegas till 6 pm. If you are traveling with children or seniors this will be very difficult for them and hotel don't care
plus^Grand super resort, with every amenity you need to enjoy a stay in Vegas - All the staff & facilities lived up to expectations.  The David Copperfield show was well worth the money - join M Life cards (free) for a ticket discount (use the concierge as they are top pro's!)
minus^The Location - it's on the south end of the strip, which means lots of taxi rides or hot walks if you want to visit other hotels.  (We didn't use Monorail, which is also another option) The lack of enforcement to discourage people walking through the hotel with shirts off or very little clothing on from the pool.
minus^I didn't like the attitude and pathetic attempt to resolve their mistake. I had booked a day bed in the morning for the pool area in a particular area I like. I had advised staff that I would not be back until 2:00, they confirmed that was not a problem. However when I returned the day bed had been given to someone else. It took 30mins to find out what had happened and another 20mins of pathetic excuses and pathetic alternative offers.  Nobody apologied and accepted that they made a mistake! Over all the attitude I got and the pathetic attempt to resolve their mistake ruined my birthday. Several times I was made to feel that it was my mistake or I was being unreasonable. It was pointed out that check in time was between 10:00-11:00, trying to make it out that it was my fault. Despite the fact that it had been confirmed by MGM staff that a 2:00 check in would be ok, at the time I booked the bed. After I reluctantly accepted an alternative no one from the check in staff or their manager returned to see that we I was happy. I was extremely disappointed by the attitude I got, the lack of urgency to resolve the issue, along with the attempt to shift the blame and failure to deal with disappointed expectations.
plus^Location is good, and pool facilities large and relatively (for Vegas) children friendly
minus^Noise everywhere. Pool can only be reached through arcade with shops and restaurants which means you have to walk through the whole hotel in your swimwear (didn't check if they have changing facilities by the pool). No fridge or coffee-making facilities in room. Other hotel facilities generally overprized.
plus^I stayed here three times before the renovation, this was my first time back. The place is really quite nice now after the renovation. Rooms on par with aria, just without the automated touch screen stuff. Go and see Ka.
minus^Quite far away from the cool area of the strip now.
plus^Nothing - a disaster 
minus^We booked suites and requested interconnecting room months in advance. We were put on Level 4 which is the roof of the casino floor and we had a 1 meter high air conditioning stack outside the window vibrating all night. After failing to move us after three nights we moved and stayed at the Wynns instead - a big difference to see staff fall over themselves to help you at Wynns. If you like loud parties in adjoining rooms stay at mgm 
plus^Convenient location, clean room
minus^The cost in internet when I made the reservations was different than the one I really paid for the hotel cost, they charged beverages that I did not take from the fridge.
plus^It started bad, BUT IT TURN GREAT BECAUSE THE DAY WAS OVER. IT WAS MY 50TH BIRTHDAY! !!!!!!! Thank you for a GREAT BIRTHDAY! !!!!!!
minus^The first wasn't clean!!!
plus^The pool is amazing, the in room dining service is great, excellent food. The hotel is amazing, all the amenities, the room has a beautiful and nice decoration.
minus^Things are too expensive. I asked for a room with a view of the strip and got one facing just a concrete wall on the 8th floor, with the strip in the back. I asked for a king sized bed and they gave me 2 queens.
minus^The variety of restaurants and the food court was great. The West Wing was quiet and close to The Strip. The room was clean and kept that way each day. The staff was friendly and helpful. Enough space at the swimming pools and entertainment theatres right on your doorstep.
plus^Staff was very helpful - hotel was very clean and conveniently located in the Strip; variety of places to eat and drink ; casino was fun!!!
minus^Nothing !!!
plus^Absolutely perfect hotel great pool parties.
minus^upon departure they debited our credit card twice without permission (disclosed once back in UK). If you call customer services it is a 45 min wait to an international number to be greeted by the most incompetent inept of staff. After several calls and emails no resolution so instructed my credit card company to refuse payment.
minus^MGM Grand is a fantastic place to stay at. Really clean, nice rooms and staff are lovely. We especially liked lounging by the pool and having the beer delivered to our seats :)
plus^Nothing about this property stood out in my mind - I was underwhelmed.
minus^The billing procedure - the hotel charges a $200 deposit to cover incidentals ??  Never heard of such a thing & I will be watching my cc statement to see how much this stay really cost.
plus^No service, contempt.Horror
minus^I booked a room months in advance and asked for a connecting door between the rooms that we are a family with three children. At 6 pm I got to the lobby In Lobby told me that no connecting door. I asked to speak to the manager and he said? That I can go look for another hotel. No service, contempt. Perhaps with or without us like we got rooms in the shelter
minus^There were no rooms with king size bed, so we were given a room with 2 queen size beds in the tower. The room was great! I suggest booking rooms in towers. They are far better than the standard ones.
plus^nothing
minus^we waited 45 minutes plus to check in to get the room. finally got to the room  with NO: microwave ,frig , coffee maker .  we  headed to the pool .  The lazy river was full of people standing in it drinking and spilling drinks in the water .  we went over to the pool for a few  hours to see kids eating nachos , drinks  etc.  while in the pool . trash all over,  bottles  etc.  laying all over.  Nobody came around the whole time to clean up.      2 fights broke out in the pool, secutiry called .    We were all done  with this !!   We stayed earlier in the week at Tahiti hotel, about  2 miles down on strip  for the same price ,  easy check in,  lazy river and nice pools .  coffee , frig , kitchen in room  etc.   MGM over rated !!!!
plus^Simple clean rooms.
minus^Too big for the traveler for business having need to take several bags in and out everyday. Asked for a place close to elevator, but had pull a huge bag like well over hundred meters.
minus^Location Location! By far one of the best stays I've had in Vegas, from Hakkasan to the best Pool Party. Friendly and professional staff from the moment we arrived. I will definitely be returning!
plus^Nothing
minus^Old wing worse than a motel room window on wall soft bed small sink no refrigerator very far to reach very very expensive for the accommodation wifi not working
minus^We move to MGM from palazzo, we saw posters in the casino and some outside adv. the same day we check-in, there was a pool party in the hotel wet republic, we ask the reception and the front desk to confirm, they said the wet republic was close, that makes us so confuse, end up we didn't go, but later on we check instagram, there was a pool party there. the second day we stay, my friend's slippers broken, so she call room service to require a slipper, the staff was so rude to told her that she can't require a pair of slipper,they do have slipper but that's for suite only, and we call reception,the staff was cool not nice, gave her the same answer. This kind of service is not a stars hotel is a B&B. Even the rate is cheap but not worth to its price.
plus^Loved the resort, clean, comfortable bed, and easy access to the strip.
minus^Elevator Access, trouble with shuttle to airport, and the price of the breakfast Buffett.
plus^The main two things that distinguish MGM from the rest of the Vegas Hotels are the pool which is espectacular and the events that happen in the hotel facilities such as Wet Republic and Hakkasan. Location is also great!
minus^We first stayed in the cheapest rooms which i found to be too small for a long stay of more than 3-4 days. Had to upgrade but next room with view was excellent.
plus^Love the location of this property. Loved having the sectional sofa in our room with separate seating/lounge area.
minus^When we arrived our room was fantastic at first glance. However, upon sitting on the bed and pulling covers back, we discovered an empty beer can sitting by one of the beds that had not ben picked up. There was also two unopened beer cans in the bedside drawers. My child (15) found those and I wasn't happy about that at all. That could pose a real problem! The bathroom also had trash left in it from the previous guests.
plus^The lounges and bars are nice. KA is a fantastic show. Most of the restaurants are good. You can access the monorail and get pretty much anywhere on the strip. Easy access to airport.
minus^The standard room is called the West Wing and it is quite far from the lobby. It is part of a very old section of the hotel. Pretty dark hallways. Noisy. The bathroom was not private. The sink did not drain well. Lighting in bathroom is awful. Cheap price is deceiving because of pricey MGM resort fee.
plus^I knew they had remodeled, but I wasn't expecting much. The room was really nice and conformable to be in, I would come back.
minus^The door were kinda thin, you could hear people out in the hallway.
minus^All staff that I dealt with on my trip were extremely kind and helpful. The hotel itself is second to none. Very clean and lively. My room was excellent and all the room service were excellent. Even when I locked myself out my room I went to reception and they had security at my door to let me in within a matter of minutes. I then ended up standing chatting with him for around 10 mins. So friendly.
plus^Liked the hotel room. It was comfortable and stylish. All staff members were courteous and gracious.
minus^Did not like the ground floor where the casino, check-in, and ticket offices are. Too much noise and stimuli all over the place. Checking in was similar to checking in at a crowded airport. Directional signage could be improved--especially on how to get out of the hotel. Not a pleasant atmosphere at all.
plus^Loved the pool and how the layout and convenient everything was.
minus^How wet republic was 40$ for girls even if you were staying at the hotel. So me and the girls went to encore where it was a lot cheaper.
plus^I love MGM for its atmosphere, rooms, pools and location!
minus^The food at the restaurant by the pool (we had breakfast sandwich and breakfast burrito) was bland and greasy...lots of other places to chose from though!
plus^Check in was fantastic, and the little bakery by the elevators was surprisingly good! Breakfast at the cafe was soooo good!
minus^Disliked the lack of a coffee maker in the room. Desperately needed coffee and it sucked to have to walk forever to get some in the morning.
plus^The superb service from the staff throughout the hotel. Nothing was too much trouble.
minus^The free wifi was not good at all. I was disappointed with this in comparison to other hotels visited where I had no problem.
plus^The AC was great, and the blinds were excellent. Excellent staff and good customer service. Self parking (free) is appreciated.
minus^Hugh hotel, and being Vegas some very noisy people. But the noise stopped by 10pm so not so bad.
plus^Staff was very friendly and everyone was helpful. Are at their buffet which was great and also in food court which was covenient and fairly priced. Bed was super confortable.
minus^I booked a king and ended up with a bedroom with 2 queens. What's the point of booming and paying for one thing but getting another? Also gym was super small. Stayed here more out of curiosity but will prob stay at Aria or Cosmopolitan from now on.
plus^Amazing hotel
minus^The hotel is humongous which is nice but it's not a hotel to stay in if you have trouble walking far distance, it feels like a 3 mile walk just from your room to the exit, we are fit but it just got too much every day especially if you left something in your room & had to go back to get it
minus^IMHO it's a fraud to sell some kind of room when it's not really available on arrival. Didn't received any explanation, replacement or compensation.  Also we are not satisfied with room state. Will recommend to avoid this hotel.
minus^We booked through booking.com, which is a good site. However, the hotel then over charged the room cost. Also tried to double charge taxes and tried to charge us for the use of use of expendables in the room (they have sensors under the items, if you shift them they automatically get added to your bill). The staff were unhelpful when trying to sort the issues out. Overall, a bad experience.
plus^Easy to find, valet parking, quick check-in even during busy times (super nice staffers here), and extremely nice rooms.
minus^Asian dealers were friendly but hard to understand (language).  White male dealers (Texas Hold-Em) seemed to be annoyed when I asked how the betting was to play out. Like he was not there to inform how to play the game. Unlike my last visit where they took the time to explain how the gamesworked).  This guy was just not friendly at all.  I know they have a job to do but people that don't play that often would still like to learn without being made out like an idiot.
plus^Comfy and clean bed, standard room is great (declined $20 upgrade possibility to a deluxe room). Good deal off-weekend.
minus^Very busy (more than expected), one night was enough. Getting something from the car is almost a hike as the place is so big! Couldn't get my iPhone to connect with the wifi.
plus^Lazy River pool is fun for the kids. Sound system is great for party.
minus^Buffet food NOT good. Prices for the buffet food are too high. Simply put - disappointing.
plus^The location of this hotel was great, the pool was excellent. The cleanliness of the hotel was to a high quality along with helpful staff.
minus^The rooms were on the small side with an open plan(ish) bathroom.
plus^Very clean well serviced room.
minus^We were on a non smoking floor but the smell of cigarette smoke seems to have been absorbed into the bones of the building.  The staff are on automatic.
plus^Comfortable room, clean. Excellent hotel facilities, so many options for food/drink/entertainment. A true Vegas experience!
minus^Food and drink options in the hotel were pretty expensive.
plus^Shows, food, awesome room
minus^That I asked for champagne to be in the room with rose petals, and I did not even get a reply saying you could not accomadate. After paying almost 600.00 for 2 nights I think someone should have at least said they could not accomadate
plus^The UFC event was my reason for visiting but I enjoyed the Black Jack tables and swift drink service also. Easy walk to other good locations in the strip.
minus^The speedy checkout didn't work but the normal check out wasn't busy thankfully
plus^I liked the fact that the staff were friendly - especially the cleaners who would be allowed to clean my room at almost any time of day.
minus^In future there should be a kettle on the room if one wanted to drink some tea.
minus^I absolutely didn't like the customer service it was horrible. Some of them were very rude at explaining simple things on which you need clarification on. They would ask how was your stay?  and after you would respond, it felt like they didn't care to even hear. Which made it seem as if it was a forced question that must be asked. I was very unhappy. The worst part was the smell it was to strong, and definitely not a neutral smell. This experience was an eye opener, especially when you come from staying the last three days at the Venetian.
plus^friendly staff, food location
minus^i wad given a connecting room but soundproof was very bad. As there was an argument next door but IT was very loud and could be heard for more than 30minutes. After security came up To check IT was still rather same.
plus^Excellent hotel and good location exactly on the main strip. All staff we're very helpful and welcoming. Would definitely go back to hotel. Good pools and wet republic.
minus^Think they should be a shower room for people who have checked out to freshen up before there flight.
plus^Quick check-in and check-out.
minus^Free wifi is dial-up speed, $$ for faster. $25/nite for a room frig. Two free umbrellas per pool, it was 106 degrees and $$ if you want an umbrella.
plus^Got free room upgrade, with kind services. Quick Checkout and other services was great. Quite and comfortable bedding and amenities were great too.
minus^the best rooms on the floor located the most far side from the elevator.
plus^The pools complex is big and you can stay hours in the lazy river.
minus^The casino and building itself is dated and is fairly dull in comparison to other locations on the strip.
plus^Just returned from a fab stay at mgm. Fantastic staff, facilities and room. Clean, buzzing with vegas life and staff who were great at all times-especially at check in and check out. Will definitely recommend to friends and stay there again. 
minus^Ooo the music by the pool !! I can understand that music has to be played (this vegas after all!) but why oh why do we have to listen to dance music around the pool being played loudly and at the same time as when Wet Republic is on?? It all ends up as one nasty mash up as the poolside music and wet republic set competes against each other. Results in a headache and neither sets of music can be clearly heard or enjoyed. If we were in vegasonger we would have gone elsewhere to another hotel to sunbathe and swim. 
plus^Tye wifi didnt work at my staff, and I went to complain. Lucky me ,meet a staff called Aimee,finally she found a solution for me, asked me.to buy phone cards,and she took out the resorts fee from the charges. Thats fair
minus^There's no shower caps,tooth paste and tooth brush @our room. Asking for it,till we checked out,nothings send to.our room. Wifi is hopeless.
minus^Location is excellent.  KA was incredible and in the hotel.  Room was upgraded and was possibly the most beautiful suite I've stayed in.  Large bathroom and lots of space in bedroom.  The best blocker blinds :)
plus^Great pools, staff was awesome. Adam the life guard sang and danced throughout the day. Tom Colicchios steak house was amazing, both service and food. Casino staff were continuously checking to see if you wanted anything. KA show was worth every penny. Great place to stay and be entertained.
minus^Cleaning staff could be better. But it was alright. Room wasn't vacuumed in 3 days, kept our shoes on.
plus^The room was huge! It faced the castle as my toddler called it. She had a blast. 
minus^Everything was expensive. $100 meal w/tip at Rainforest Café for one entrée, two beers, one toddler meal, and a side salad w/chicken... 
plus^Our room was fine however once in the hotel chaos.
minus^Our booking had been cancelled. We had gifts and cards sent to the hotel for our wedding which were not delivered. No customer service. Pestered about check out. $18 for a morning coffee or walk forever to Starbucks is ridiculous. We bought a coffee maker in the end. I would never stay here again.  Wish I'd booked the Wynn.
plus^Everything is there. Employees very nice and helpful.
minus^The dark out drape in my room did not work so was unable to get a good night sleep due to the sun coming up at 5am. Also my door had to be slammed shut or would not close.,
plus^The location
minus^There was trash in the trash cans when we arrived and it took sometime for house keeping to arrive but the hotel seemed to be very busy that nite
plus^great pool, food, casino and location
minus^place is like a maze a few more staff available for directions would be useful especially when first arriving as it took us 15 minutes to find our room
plus^Location
minus^Way too expensive for such a small room. You can hear all the noise outside from your room. No refrigerator or microwave. You can't check in until 4pm. I am disgusted. The Hilton had way better accommodations and their pool was better.
plus^Beds very comfortable, valet parking excellent. Very convenient to everything.
minus^No coffee pot in room. Most hotel and motel has complimentary coffee at least. Did not like the censor frig that is way overboard almost highway robbery
plus^The hotel staff was excellent at handling everything I needed. The mgm has everything you could think of and more. The best vacation location I can think of.
minus^The spa cancelled my massage for my boyfriend bday trip. Then they charged my card for $324 anyway. Still haven't heard from them.
plus^The staff were all really friendly, from the hotel lobby when I arrived, to the maids in the corridor who always said hello, and the bar staff who were happy to chat.
minus^There were a couple of loose hairs around the room, mainly on the night stand and breakfast tray, but nothing too gross.  Signage could be a little clearer, it's almost as though you needed to find the shortcuts.
plus^The MGM Grand is enormous and has lots of places to eat and shop (and of course gamble).  Our room was very modern.  Lots of pools.
minus^Because the place is so enormous, it's easy to feel like a tiny ant in a giant over-crowded nest.  Our room wasn't as clean as we would have liked and there was someone's broken acrylic nail on the floor when we walked in which was pretty gross.  While the pools are great, they are VERY crowded with lots of drunk people - fun if you are ready to join in - not so much if you're not.
plus^Location and a good casino
minus^Over mechanical and lacks in basic s. A hotel room for which we paid $400 doesn't even offer a coffee maker and a complimentary water bottle in the room is just not acceptable
plus^They upgraded our rooms
minus^The first room we got was dirty so we had to transfer to another room.  The price quoted us by booking.com DID NOT match the fee charged by MGM.  Our rooms cost us $37 more per night per room.
plus^everything was wery good exept some staff attitude. When we arived guy in front desk was amazing and helpful a lot. Also some staff was amazing and explaining how to play black jack , as I neve did before.
minus^First day when we went to sleep we did find dirty bedsheets , so next morning we asked front desk to change,girl said ok , she did not apologise , etec. Also we ask hear aboutwhere we canfind Las Vegas sign and shops,she was unable to provide information. She was acting as we need to know , not her. Also 2 older ladies serving drinks when I was playing was wery unhappy If I will tip $1 when I ewswv drink , why not more !!
plus^Free parking
minus^The hotel was very dirty; Cigarettes on the floor, bottle of beer and a fork in the elevator. Smelled like a communist hotel; old and uncleaned.  No complimentary water. We had to pay more than expected as there is a resort fee 30$ per night and  you have to pay tax for that tax ( Booking shows it after the excluded tax applied per room)
plus^Good room / bath size. Location is good and has a metro station on sight.
minus^very big hotel so u have to walk from one way to another to reach your room. Housekeeping was not good, they didnot keep fresh towels in the room.
plus^Great hotel, very busy, so much choice in restaurants, the pool is great
minus^Booked a king bed, got a double queen as room booked was not available, not ideal for a  wedding anniversary! Hotel staff tried their best to sell us room upgrade but less concerned they could not fully honour our booking, said it was in the t&c's but i could not find it. In fairness they offered to move us on the second day but could not be bothered with the hassle of repacking and moving
plus^Pool, location, comfortable bed and pillows.
minus^Have to pay extra for fitness centre. Meals, drinks, water expensive.  We are non smokers, the casino was very smoky but unfortunately that is everywhere in Vegas.
plus^The location is good, the restaurants were excellent and the poker room had a good mix of games and tournaments.
minus^Staff not that bothered, very impersonal and you had to hire fridges
plus^Bed, Wi Fi
minus^Small room on ground floor. Alarm goes off at 4am in the morning. We can hear people running in the halls, throwing up next door and going to the bathroom upstairs. Truly disappointed with the room we received.
plus^Great choice of restaurants, shops, the pools are brilliant too. Best of all are the staff, the friendliest by far out of all the hotels on the strip.
minus^Only things that annoyed me a little was the power of the shower, I have very long hair and it took me longer to wash it! Also the hairdryer in the room was one from the 70s with no nossle so I had frizzy hair for the week (concierge didn't have a good hairdryer and the hairdresser was 85 for a blow dry and booked out).
plus^I liked most Ka theatre and casino
minus^Our room bill was messed up right from beginning.  In room there are real time monitoring option for room bill. After first night we saw other peoples room bill but not our own. Scary! We complain about it 5times. Nothing happend.
plus^close to the airport
minus^The resort fee is very high for an overnight stay !!!  No coffee pot in room and the ice machine was not working so we had to go to another floor.
plus^the seimming pool is great. you should eat on cabana Grill. delivious. servants at the pool are always around there. Smiley for sure. great shows in one hotel and a great location for monorail as well
minus^not till now 
plus^Lots to do within the huge complex, Wet Republic pool party was great
minus^Expensive (even basics like bottle of water), too many people around, hotel needs an upgrade, too many extra costs (probably for all hotels on the strip though)
plus^Great facilities, great location. 
minus^The price quoted by Booking.com and the one mgm tried to charge me was double. This took at least 2 hours of time to figure out, but eventually was resolved. Big hassle however and my group was left in the lurch waiting to check-in. 
plus^I had some of the best steak and lobster I've ever had! We'll worth it. Wet Republic was also a blast!
minus^As with any casino, the layout is like a maze. I got lost several times.
plus^Location is just in the strip and the full of restaurants. David Copperfield just hold his show in the hotel.
minus^Room is tiny and with unpleasant smell,have to wait long time to checkin and checkout. Messy!!!Service is bad even refused even we called to bring us slipper.  There are too many choices on the strip. I recommend you guys to choose others like PH that is cheaper then it.
plus^Good Location , Amazing Facilities, Good choice of shows .
minus^Wet Carpet in 1/4 of the Room for all the 3 nights we were there. Doors too noisy. High Price comparing with other similar hotels on the Strip
plus^The location is good in MGM and the facilities of the restaurants and choice. The beds were very comfy too!
minus^Compared to Caesers/Bellagio/Ventian where we have stayed previously, the rooms were easily half the size and a bit tired. The staff are also not as helpful. Our room was a connecting room with some loud people next door up all night but when we complained but nothing was appreciated or compensated.
plus^Lovely pool, restaurants, and bar, really friendly staff for such a massive hotel, great for using the monorail which saved loads on taxis, and the food court when wanting a cheap snack instead of the expensive restaurants.
minus^Such a big hotel, it's a long walk to get anywhere
plus^My husband and I had such a ball, we arrive a late for check in due to our flight being delayed and to our surprise, we got upgraded. Wow to start a stay.
minus^That we only stay for 4 days wish we had more time.
plus^The facilities and location the room was nice too
minus^We didn't get room service (our room cleaned) for two days. Our hot water was out and after they repaired it twice they didn't changed our room.
plus^Comfortable King Bed.  Easy checkout process.  Amazing facilities however restaurants were quite expensive for food, even the food court was overpriced and average food.
minus^Package did not include breakfast.  Could not access the fridge without getting charged to unlock.  Roll out sofa bed was not very comfortable.
plus^The staff was very friendly. The room was clean and with a nice whirlpool. The bed was comfortable and for the price we payed the room was very big. 
minus^Our spa Suite was on the 4th floor and the room windows were facing the hakkasan outside wall... I believe that if you book on booking.com the room you will get is not a first class room. Pay attention to the breakfast buffet, because on the weekend the price goes up due to the free alcoholic beverages, even if you don't drink at breakfast (we, group of 4, payed 78$ on thursday and 130$ on friday!!) The mini bar in our room was locked with a code and we haven't had any idea how to open it. 
minus^Great stay, professional, clean, location. Just don't book with a Travel Money Card (or if you do be prepared to shell out $300 in cash for a room deposit - fair enough). Also watch the door closes behind you, some hinges are old and the door will stop short of shutting (and locking) when you leave. Last, if you're moving things around in your room watch out for the sensors on the mini bar (its annoying to explain you didn't consume anything at checkout).
plus^We arrived for check in around 1030pm which provided us with an upgraded room as the cheaper ones we had booked were full by this time. We were in the sleepwell level which is all anti-allergy stuff and it was a nice room. The blockout blinds worked a treat for sleeping in the next morning. Ok view, our room was facing south so couldn't really see the strip.
minus^We had travelled around 36 hours with no sleep to get here so when we arrived the Valet parking agent was super friendly and got our bags, put them on a trolley and started walking off towards reception. As we were pretty tired we just followed...and were not given a ticket for the valet parking. When we realised the next morning and went to the Valet station to collect the car, they were quite rude about it and made it seem like we had lost the ticket. We were in a rental car and luckily had a photo of the number plate.
minus^World-famous MGM is just an ordinary hotel in Las Vegas, compared to other 2 hotels I also experienced. Standard room with standardized facilities. Clean and tidy, but not very impressive.
plus^Very great location a lot of Activity ,I love David Coperfild show,and they give VIP seats for people who's staying in the hotel in lower price,Big hotelas well I love it .
minus^Luxury
plus^They were overbooked when we arrived, so instead of two rooms we were given a two bedroom suite (good one). Huge amount of outlets and amenities
minus^Internet was a disaster, we had to use public one almost all days. Public Internet is very bad at many times. Cleaning was also very bad, one day they just made beds, no vacuum
plus^facilities, clean room, friendly staff, free parking, casino
minus^Website not up to date, pool hours were wrong and buffet was listed 10 dollars cheaper online. The pool was also quite dirty and the price was pretty high but that is normal for the Vegas strip.
plus^The room was comfortable and reasonably quiet
minus^Typical large hotel in Vegas with facilities a bit dated and terrible decor. Dining either junk food of relatively expensive.
plus^Location is great and facilities are modern.
minus^I had to wait in a queue for more than an hour to check in. I took the shuttle from the hotel to the airport but he picked people up at another location before returning to the MGM to pick even more people so plan way ahead of time. The lighter shade in my room wouldn't work. I
plus^Hakkasan Club and Wet Republic was amazing!
minus^The room was dirty and it stinks. It was not worth the price we had paid. I would not stay there again if I go back to Vegas for a holiday.
plus^The location is good at the top of the strip. Rooms  comfortable.
minus^Checking in was awful. You have to wait in a long line for 30 min to check in. To make matters worse they mixed up the room keys with our friends so when it came to checking out our bills were the wrong way out. They encourage you to check out using  their  television link It wasn't working.  Then they turned our room keys off  before checkout time whilst we were having breakfast and locked us out of  our room. They need to improve their systems.
plus^First the staff was very friendly and helpful and quick about checking in. I stayed in a Stay Well room, during the weekend of Rock in Rio. I absolutely loved all of the amenities included with the room the vitamin C shower was excellent as well as the room air purifier not to mention the beds were very comfortable. I absolutely loved how they had put the rooms together in the stay well rooms. The next time I visit Vegas definitely getting a stay well room again.
minus^Nothing to complain about here.
plus^Great casino with a plenty of facilities. Good quality, fair price
minus^In casino, if you dont tip the waitress, she might be very ruxe to you and she was very rude to us.
plus^Everyone was friendly and it was quick to check in.
minus^Wasn't expecting pay a security deposit when I got there and had to figure out how to come up with extra cash.
plus^Classy hotel with plenty of things to do. Beautiful place and a masive casino
minus^There is a lot of extra fees that are not explained that would make your stay quiet expensive (at least $100 more per day)
plus^Rooms were clean, facilities were  fairly clean, bed was comfy, check in/out was easy
minus^For the price of $750.00 for 3 night it would have been nice to get Comp tickets to a show...our room had clouded glass for the toilet area. It was partially see through,  neither one of us liked that and we've been together 7 years. I felt the price I paid was a bit high for what we got overall. We will try another hotel next time...weren't exactly won over here.
minus^We had to wait 1.5 hours for our luggage to be collected from our room on check-out.  If we had been informed about the length of the delay at the beginning, we would have just carried our luggage ourselves.  The staff at the bell desk were rude to us when we called to check progress just informing us that they were busy and giving us no time estimates. The check in of 3pm is very late compared to most other hotels and is quite an inconvenient time of day to have to wait to check in. The check in queue is also immensely long and slow. On check in my credit card was charged without being informed this would happen, usually only a hold is put on a card for extras when they room has been paid in advance. When I asked the reception staff to send me an updated invoice detailed our expenses, they sent me the invoice for the incorrect room which was unhelpful.
plus^n we got there they put us in a very poor room on the west wing Alexander was great he helped us get a better room at the same rate hello lady I called was rude and wanted to charge us more money so thank God that got Alexander us a better room
minus^the first room we were in was not clean it was cold mall and there was a bug in it everything there cost you money no free water no free breakfast is to know nothing we spend a lot of money there gambling and we feel like we got nothing in return we didn't even went reward points system is terrible compared to other casinos
minus^What you see in pictures of the bedroom and what you actually receive is completely different. They should show you a real picture of what you actually going to receive!
plus^Given a cut price upgrade so the room was lovely and big with lounge room, great for us with our kids aged 10 & 14. However, we actually never even sat on the couch, it was handy for our 3rd suitcase and associated clothes and crap, keeping it all out of our way.
minus^The mini bar has a counter in it, if you take the goods out it gives you about 60 seconds to put it back before it charges things to your bill. We also needed a small fridge for our sons medication to be kept cold as it cannot be kept in the mini bar fridge.  They sent up a small fridge but it didn't work, by the time we realised this, the medication was ruined.  Fridge was replaced (provision is at no charge as it's for medical purposes) but too late for us.
plus^the staff is helpful. When I came into my room, the previous guest hasn't leave! The staff apologised and upgrade our room.
minus^the hotel is too big so you can hardly feel they are serving you. It's the first time I need keep in lines for check in and out, and taxi...
plus^Facilities, location and assistance from staff when betting as we are not regular gamblers
minus^The air conditioning was very noisy so could not sleep most nights Bathroom facilities not great.
minus^I didn't like the fact of how we was treated. I thought it was rude and unprofessional. I was waiting on a manager to call me from the time I checked in until the time I left. Never received anything. Very disappointed.
plus^Room generally clean and nice. High up in the building with a good view.
minus^Waited 44 minutes at check-in. There were not enough staff to cope with the arriving guests. Many counters were not staffed and the check-in process was unbelievably slow. I guess they don't want to bother with creating a good customer service and a satisfactory feeling, as guests come anyway and people stream into Vegas and fill all hotels, irrespective of quality.
plus^Location, amenities, pool area
minus^During a weekend with such a huge event and the massive cost of staying during that event it would have been nice if the hotel had prioritized its guests in someway for staying there. Like offering them priority to the weigh in- something inexpensive but would have been a nice touch for going there for the fight weekend at ridiculous costs and being loyal to MGM or a closed opportunity for MGM only guests to pay to get an autograph and photo with someone famous exclusively for MGM guests- would have been nice to have felt the MGM had been worth the expense with opportunities like that Also I really missed having no kettle and mini bar in the room :-(
plus^there are a huge amount of facilities in this hotel, which we made great use of. we used the pool, went to the wet republic pool party and went to Hakkasan nightclub as well as visiting one or two restaurants, etc. Room really comfortable with an amazing view.
minus^The permanent smell of smoke the moment you left your room, even on a non-smoking floor. Be careful of the small print when booking. We didnt realize there was an extra fee (i think it was called a facilities fee or something) when we arrived. It was in the small print and we overlooked it.
plus^The location; access to NY NY Casino; shops nearby on the strip; access to the monorail; free wi-fi.
minus^The smoke. People smoking everywhere, even in the elevators. Non-smoking room policy seems a bit of a joke.  In room refrigerator that could not be used for private use.
minus^Gave me a room that someone else was in, called downstairs, waited a long time for security to come and let me in another room. He came and then I had to go get the keys from the front desk. Later went back to room and keys wouldn't work. Had to go back downtstairs , wait and get new keys. They promised to take off accommodation fee for the inconvenience, but they did not do it. I was disappointed with the service but loved everything else. 
minus^Very clean, the staff was super nice, the casino was cool, and the food was great! You're right on the strip so sight seeing is easy but the hotel is so nice, you may not want to leave!!!
plus^Me and my partner went for 6 days before going down to San Diego The place is great Restaurants are fabulous, all staff were beyond courteous and when we needed something were more than happy to do it, obviously everybody expects a dollar or two but that's Vegas baby  Club was great, bars are superb, you can get excellent craft berets, a massive range of tequila, cocktail to die for etc etc  Pools were loveley, set beautifully and plenty of room and beds and free towels etc  Cannot complain for the money we spent Location is fantastic at the main start of the strip with a monorail inside  Obviously it's not as swish as the Aira but it's very very good Don't think that the cheap rooms are cheap either, we popped our head into the 'bottom' of the range while cleaners were in, lovely and with 48 inch led tv's, you get the drift  Recommended
minus^Nothing
plus^Pool was great.  Kids enjoyed the lazy river
minus^Not very family friendly.  More catered to spring breakers.  Room wasn't good.  Green light shined in room all night and family couldn't sleep (no curtains).   Were suppose to stay 4 nights but only stayed one.  Transferred to the bellagio after 1 night.
plus^Rooms were awsome
minus^Well check out was at 11 am and it was 8:30 -or 9 and my husband was taking a shower and  housekeeping opend the door to our room luckaly the door had the lock on top twice the 3 rd time was not locked and they walked right in omg cant the wate till 11
plus^+ location + facilities
minus^+ maintenance problem in the bathtub. When you empty water from bathtub, dirty water was appearing at the shower + everything is extra and expensive
plus^Large room.
minus^Long wait to check in, like an airport check in, waited over half an hour in line to be served.  No tea or coffee making facilities.  Fridge is only fot mini bar.
plus^Hotel is gorgeous , rooms nice bed made every single day and new towels every single day good connection free wifi in our room with a 'safe' also provided free of charge, our flight was cancelled for 25 hours and hotel happily changed our booking giving us a refund for our first night and booking an extra night no problems, nice pool area and wet republic was amazing !!! Also free boarding pass printing service was handy
minus^29$ resort fee per night however still having to pay 20$+ entry fee for wet republic pool which is in mgm grand. 2 hour+ queue to check in when we arrived after a 25 hour flight delay we really weren't happy to see a queue of 600+ people, got food poison from the asian food shop in the hotel called 'pandasian'  . requested a room with a nice view when booking and got a room facing opposite side of strip down to the parking bay in front of hotel
plus^We get the room on the cardio floor, which was very big and beautiful, the casino was great, the stuff was helpful .all the time
minus^Their was a lot of butterfly inside our  room, it was inconvenience and the stuff has no way how to deal with iT.
plus^The room was phenomenal, and since we were traveling from Ohio and had a rough trip in, it was wonderful to relax as soon as we got there. The couch was comfy; bathroom was amazing! Bed was so-so, but I have an expensive mattress at home and nothing is like my own bed.  Really, I liked it ALL! Can't wait to come back. Will stay at MGM again.
minus^I'm spoiled with the no-smoking laws in Ohio. Though the casino was well ventilated and the smoke wasn't too bad, it was still an insult to my nose. :) I dealt with it.
plus^Love that the location is so near the strip. Easy access to all the hotels nearby. Near a convenience store semi souveneir shop. Enjoyed the attractions inside and outside the hotel.
minus^So far no complaints.
plus^Waitress at restaurant (2 in the morning) believe her name was Carrie (from HA).  Exceptional service and made us feel very welcomed.
minus^At departure, long lines.
plus^Lots of things to see and do inside the hotel/casino.
minus^We didn't like the overwhelming smell of cigarette smoke and perfume/cologne While walking through the casino.
plus^Rooms were excellent. Staff very helpful. Located south of the centre strip. Loads of food options. Pool area was lovely. Very simple check out.
minus^We had to queue for almost an hour to check in on a sunday, but noticed it wasn't this bad in the week for other people.  They could do with more waitresses in the casino to provide drinks when you're gambling.
plus^A comfortable bed, a clean room, superb location, friendly staff
minus^WI-FI is so weak and works unpredictably; there was a garbage on the floor when we checked in.
plus^We liked the fact that our room was smoke free - the rest of the hotel smelt of stale cigarette smoke. The swimming pool area was great. My bed was nice and comfortable.
minus^The added advantages of staying in a 'Stay Well' room were not explained to us when we checked in, hence we missed out on making the most of our room booking extras. (They were only explained when we checked out!!!). The WiFi connection was patchy.  There were no tea/coffee making facilities in our room.
plus^The woman, Sandy, who assisted me after all the long wait and mistakes with my room was wonderful.
minus^Waited over 45 minutes to check in, and was told that was better than the 90 minutes folks had earlier in the day. Got up to the room, but it was occupied. Was not pleased with the wait to get assistance again.
plus^Lots of places to eat, centrally located to the strip.
minus^Wasn't a bad experience but all the hype of the MGM I was disappointed in things for the room.  Such as not able to use the in room fridge.  No kettle to boil water to make your own cup of tea.   I feel there's room for improvement such as  cleanliness of the rooms wasn't top notch.  Lots of dust sitting around certain areas of the room!
plus^The location on the strip The friendly staff
minus^Still needs a better way to circulate the smoke out of the casino so all player can enjoy the games and stay longer. This was my first time going to Vegas and the casino; I was told that if you dont know how to play any card games you would be shown, this however was not the case with me the table I sat at I found the dealer was very inpatiention so that is to say I did not enjoy that experience.
plus^Visited Vegas as the final stop of a week-long trek of the west US area, after having visited a conference in Palm Springs. The beds are comfortable and the pool is amazing!
minus^Sadly the pool got booked by a conference and as such I had no access to it one day of my stay. Gambling feels very pushed, and the audacity of smoking being allowed in a lot of areas is just plain wrong. At night 'ladies of the night' come out and frankly... the rooms get very noisy... Vegas is not for me.
minus^Grand hotel with great facilities Location is central They customer service was good: check out on machine; they mis-charged me extra room fee and they checked and refunded me quickly even after I left a few days after
plus^Pool, casino, location all fantastic.
minus^The free wifi was really poor, as some had business emails to answer this was disappointing and made us question what we were paying our resort fee for?!
plus^The hotel is huge but don't expect to get some sort of personal attention due to the large number of guests coming in and going out.
minus^Lack of personal attention, poor room service. Rest of it was perfect.
plus^The KA show
minus^Smoking Loud Noise Loud Music Distance to Pool Swearing and unruly behaviour Poor sleep quality Bar fridge non usage Overpriced food and drinks Not at all family friendly
plus^The hotel was incredible.  We didn't even leave the facility on day!  Loved the pools they were amazing! The staff was very friendly and happy.
minus^It was a long walk from the room to the pools and other activities.
plus^- Free vallet parking - Free wifi - location
minus^- lines for taxi - west wing is worst place that i stay Always stay in MGM, pay more for more confort, this time allocation me in 1st floor of west wing.  Bath leaking, sink smallest.  Worst experience, don't stay anymore
plus^Very clean facility and employees were friendly.
minus^Had room next door that had musical instruments and were playing late at night. This was a connecting room so sound traveled easier then thru a solid wall.
plus^Great hotel lived up to expectations
minus^Be careful of the mini bar?? Do not toudh anything as you will get charged for it (computerised). Ask for extra fridge for medication storeage free of charge did not tell you untill you move items about in mini bar fridge
plus^Great location Well priced
minus^Hot water in the shower was inconsistent. Sometimes it wouldn't come on at all, sometimes we had to run it for 10 minutes for it to heat up. Tried to call the front desk multiple times to arrange late check out, was left on hold for up to 20 minutes. Eventually went down to front desk and was told it was too late in the day and to call back at 8am the next morning. I did so and was on hold again for 20 minutes. Poor service for such a huge business.
plus^Every thing. I have tried most of Las Vegas hotel and MGM is one of the best in the city. Location is perfect and David Copperfield magic show was amazing.
minus^Nothing
plus^Excellent free WiFi the rooms are very spacious it's in a great location hotel facilities r fabulous loved the pool...
minus^Not exclusive to the hotel just everyone expectation for a tip even if used say hi buts that's an American thing I guess
plus^Super clean. Responsive staff. Quietness. Convenient amenities.
minus^Rooms weren't ready when we checked in. No fridge in the room. Old AC system that blows air from the side of the bed.
plus^Shows and restaurants were great, the casino, pool were fun.
minus^It took 4 hours to get a room with a AC.   The elevator broke,   The view was completely blocked and we were staring  at a wall.
plus^Shows and Location
minus^We have to pay extra fees in our reservation. We were expecting paying 370 uds for two nights and we finally pay 5000 for two nights and the service of transportation from one hotel to the other is extra for that price shoud be include.
plus^The location and the amenities, the convenience and the restaurants.
minus^The pool,jacuzzi and lazy river closed too early. There's no robes or sleepers as requested, no microwave or coffee maker and the small fridge was locked.
plus^They made a mistake but quickly made up for it by upgrading my room. Great view. Great and helpful wait staff!
minus^My room was not ready and they only had smoking available (that is still a thing in the first place?!?). My original room when finally ready, was in shambles, but they quickly made up for it by upgrading the room!
plus^location on beginning of strip
minus^as we checked out, we could not enter the WIFI anymore...would have been nice to use it at least for the day, we checked out
plus^Accommodations were excellent.
minus^Purchased two items from room bar costings $14 and left $20 and a note to maid stating $14 was for items and $6 was for her.  At checkout I was billed $14 for items with checkout person unwilling to remove.
plus^The pool area is impressive if you can find a deck chair!
minus^Our room still hadn't been cleaned from the last guests when we checked in and it took 2hrs to get into our new room that we had to ask for. The staff were not very helpful and the casino stinks!
plus^I love the MGM!! My first time staying there, it was classy, clean and luxurious. I will NEVER stay anywhere else when visiting Vegas again! I love you MGM!! Thankyou!!! Xx
minus^Everything was perfect!
plus^Pool good - long walk there.  No slides or extras.
minus^Like staying in a shopping centre.  Very expensive.  Felt like you need to be a gold member to get normal service.
minus^The difficulty of setting up the reservation, first thru the conceige desk and then needing a contract to hold the reservation.  Deposit I get, a whole contract seemed excessive. I would love to see better detailed menus and pricing on the website.
plus^Once I located how to enter the parking garage everything else was wonderful. My large family used two rooms without any complaints.  Close to all you would need in Vegas.
minus^Parking was not marked very well.
plus^Location to other attractions on the Vegas Strip
minus^Tiny room. Poor configuration that lacked bathroom privacy, especially for an adult traveling with children. Tried ordering a movie in the room, but system didn't work. Staff didn't seem to care and offered no options. Wifi was very slow when it worked which was sporadic at best.
plus^It is in a central location.  Huge casino with a few good clubs.  Huge convention centre...
minus^Breakfast isn't included...the cost of food in the food court was expensive for what you were getting.
plus^Being on the Stay Well floor! After the busy days at the trade show, coming back to our room was incredibly pleasant & peaceful. Also, we found the hotel layout very easy to navigate.
minus^There was a dirty sock from the previous guest in the corner of the room, and trash in one of the drawers. We also could not find our Deepak Chopra greeting anywhere!
plus^Location
minus^I booked MGM for a certain price which was guaranteed through Booking.com. When I got there MGM wanted me to pay more because they said the rates changed. I told them it wasn't my issue, they should deal with Booking. They were not able to solve the issue. I had to call myself to Booking which thankfully were able to get my refund.
plus^The standard bedroom is great, was bigger than we were expecting and the location is really good.
minus^when we checked in they didn't find our reservation and we had to call everyday to see if they resolved that. They didn't do anything until the check out, the good thing was that they made us a great discount for the hard time. Also, because of the season the hotel was really busy so we can hear a lot of noise outside the bedroom.
plus^It was a beatiful hotel with a great location on the strip, and the rooms were nice. We had breakfast and Avenue Cafe which was delicious. And we found the monorail to be very convenient.
minus^I get that you are trying to mask the smokey smell of people lighting cigarettes in the casino, but the heavy perfume smell they have pumping around the hotel to disguise cigarette smoke is even more obnoxiously potent than the cigarette smell itself. The perfume smell actually gave me more of a headache than anything and it was very noticeable the second you walked through the door.
plus^I particularly appreciated the spacious, comfortable, quiet room.
minus^Not a complaint - just a couple of things that would make the experience EVEN nicer - in-room coffee and some space for our own use in the mini-bar fridge would have been very welcome.
plus^All the amenities.
minus^Had too find the 2 bottles of free water and also the newspaper which were advertised as free.  The front desk upon check-in didn't know anything about these items.  All the price of the room purchased didn't agree with what the hotel was charging.
plus^The location was great
minus^The room hadn't been cleaned properly, with dust on the phones and biscuit fragments left in the drawers. The fridge was locked. The hotel wanted to charge over $10 for a cup of hot water, which seems excessive.
plus^The drive there
minus^Well where do I start after paying for what I was led to believe to be the room I was charged another 150.00 for the room. Then when we did get to are room we had no view  unless you count the roof as a view. So from now on we are just going to stay at a cheep hotel that I have stayed at before and had a better time at
plus^Only thing I loved was the bed!
minus^There is no bathroom privacy! I did not enjoy listening to my husband use the toilet (and vice versa), nor the lack of counter space. Poor lighting in the room, had only the bathroom light to work with.
plus^Modern, clean, good amenities
minus^Staff attitude, you pay alot more than what was quoted on Booking.com, a bit far from the heart of the strip, very blend food at the buffet even though is very expensive, a simple housekeeping request takes 3 hours
minus^I prepaid for 2 rooms under two travelers names, and they wouldnt allow one of the travelers to check in without paying for his own room.  However, they allowed one of them with no problem.
plus^It was a great location fun entertaining
minus^The room I booked through booking.com looked nothing like the pictures on the website. It looked like a room from cheap hotel. It was false advertisement.   We switched rooms but of course had to pay more
plus^The district and pool were a surprising change of pace from the casino floor area. Nothing felt old for a property that first opened in 93, which I found impressive, some other places don't seem to stay on top of the updates.
minus^A bit pricey, but in a great location.
plus^Location was the best, and having a really hot club on the first floor. Great for partying with easy logistics!
minus^Wifi in the bedrooms wasn't awesome, but I guess that's on purpose.
minus^The rate confirmed on the web page was for a room at the back of hotel.  No hot water no services - 2 star hotel.  I had to pay an upgrade fee to be sent to a room with hot water and what I was expecting when I booked.
plus^Location, bed was grate nice shower
minus^No mini fridge? All that money and no fridge yep, ok. The hallway looked outdated? Older side I'm assuming, blah.
minus^The room are so far from the casino 1mile at least!.The bathroom not that clean and  there is no window (one where you can not see anything behind the bed)
plus^Beautiful pool area, A food court for those who wanted to eat economically, Key drop for those with no room charges thus bypassing the significant check-out line.
minus^A bit of a line-up for check-in, the worst pillows ever.
plus^Room was nice and the only place it was possible to get a bit of quiet. Spoilt by awful music everywhere.
minus^The blaring music. Even by the pool. It would have been nice to have sat by the pool peacefully. Not everyone staying here is a teenager!
plus^Lighting, shower, and bathroom shelves for personal items.
minus^No fridge in the room. Also there should be a discounted rate for wet republic for guests of the mgm.
minus^Had to watch games in room. No tvs anywhere that were available. Food is horrible for the price. Would never eat here again. I dont mind expensive but everything is way overpriced.
minus^When we checked in there was blood on our bed, we requested a smoking room took us two days and we had to down grade our room in order to get one. We were on our honeymoon and it was not what we hoped for.
minus^the charge of the room they show me was different that the charge booking did in my debit card.  The room we ask was different that the room they gave us.
plus^I like the facilities.
minus^There is no coffee machine in rooms. Be ready  to get a lot of noise during all your night/early morning from the guests in your floor. Ones you take any thing from the fridge, you will go to pay for, even if you return it back without using it, (there is a sensor under each time)
plus^Large bathroom plus spa was amazing!!!!
minus^No one told us about the fridge situation and the fact that everything is electronically linked to our bill. Other hotel porters informed us as we checked in.
minus^No free WiFi. More importantly, I had altered my booking prior to arrival to stay one less night. Upon arrival, I confirmed with the front desk that I was departing one day earlier than their records indicated. The clerk assured me that this would be adjusted upon check out. However, I was charged for one additional night. Now I'm told that this will not be corrected for 7-10 working days. That's unacceptable. The MGM is basically using my money for those days instead of correctly crediting my account to remove a $250-plus overfilling.
plus^Nothing. Won't stay again
minus^Room was too far from elevators. They stuck us in the old tower. We requested non smoking room as my wife has very severe allergy to smoke. We asked them to change room and they said it would be more in new tower
plus^The room was good. Room service cleaned it well.
minus^The shower leaked and flooded half the room. I told the front desk. They sent someone up and said they'll fix it. same thing happened every morning.
minus^You don't need to leave the hotel,  everything is inside. Perfect location and great facilities. Make sure you stay in there new floor called stay well
plus^Didn't have to leave the mgm to attend the show we saw nor eat. Consueirres were awesome!! The show ka was amazing. 
minus^Said would have view of Strip and actually saw an alley and wall of building across. Was a struggle to put the curtain down in the room. The people at the theater box office and the people you call on the phone to ask questions about tickets are not on the same page. That was frustrating. 
plus^A very comfortable hotel. The hotel complex was relatively easy to navigate. We liked the number of in house restaurants and Starbucks outlets.
minus^The pool complex was too far from our room and we were reluctant to walk through the hotel complex to the pool.
plus^Beautiful comfortable
minus^Room with no view by dumpsters was very very loud, but someone has to have it I guess. It was very comfortable. $28 for room service coffee is beyond ridiculous... Fees are crazy!
plus^Very smart and  excellent facilities- staff very helpful  and pool area very smart .
minus^A bit too big, you had to find your way around by  looking for landmarks and signposts - best clue is to look for signs to the registration hall .
plus^The room was huge and beautiful. It was honestly bigger than some studio apartments. The bathroom was great with a 2 person tub. Even thought this room didn't get views of the strip it still had great views of Vegas with wall to wall windows. Honestly one the best rooms I have ever been in. And by far the greatest deal.
minus^Location could have been a tad better. Everything is ridiculously expensive in the hotel. Example, $7 for a can of general with room service who charges just to bring it up.
minus^Las Vegas was not my destination, but I felt comfortable at the MGM.  Received many upgrades at the check in and the concierge was very helpful finding me tickets for Cirque de Soleil, Love at discount prices. Room was great.
plus^Everthing was perfec, helpfull staff, huge facility with variaty of resturants and great wifi
minus^After i checkoutt they still have hold on more than 500$ on my credit card
plus^I like the cleaningnest of the place
minus^I did not like the fact that when I was checking in they did not tell me about the resort fees that's not cool
plus^The entertainment is  absolutely  marvellous, the attention, staff really friendly the best night club ever been.
minus^Smokers, it is really uncomfortable, as the smell is everywhere.
plus^The service was good and all were proactive and responsive
minus^Terrible room view of the adjacent roof top with all the mechanical units and piping...better to have no view at all...kept the curtains closed.
plus^Bed was amazing! No need to go any where else. It has tons of places to eat and see shows.  Oh and gamble if you want. But I don't and had a great time!#
minus^A little confusing to find your way around.
plus^Good in house restaurants like Craft Steak and Emerills.
minus^I had a wine bottle I stuck in the mini bar.  The housekeeper put my wine out and locked me out of the pathetic mini bar.  Asked the house keeper, he said to call front office.  I said no need, we are not coming back to MGM. He was ok with that or did not understand English. Either way, unacceptable for us.
plus^The room was clean front desk excellent at check in  casino clean generous machines
minus^We had room  close to elevators wich was fine it wasnt the elevators that kept us up .it was the rooms by us that were labled team rooms wich u cud constantly smell marijauna coming from it an the worst part wasthe door opening an closing througout the nite that was painfull .an early morning doors from the team room its as if the employees had absolutely no regard for the guest as they let the door shut themselves wich was so lound it wud wake us everytime it was shut all bad for us
plus^The room was nice and the beds were very comfortable. The MGM is so big you don't even have to leave the property! Last stop on the monorail made traveling Vegas a cinch.
minus^No refrigerator in the room but that is almost the norm nowadays.
plus^The David Copperfield show was awesome! The hotel lobby and casino area is very nice.
minus^We were put in a substandard room.  The sink had mold growing on it.  The mirrors were dirty. There was crud of some sort on the glass desk.  When I called the front desk to ask for a different room I was given no apology, only an offer to pay more money for an upgrade, or we could keep the same room & wait till the maid showed up to clean it. I was very disappointed in the poor service.
plus^Like staying at MGM.  Always have.  The people checking you in are always friendly.  You get fast service.  Food is always great there.
minus^Didn't like that they stuck us in the west wing.  Felt like a basement.  Just getting there was a hike and a half but we did find a 'shorter' way of getting out.  I thought they were going to place us in a special room.  They asked if it was a special occasion and we mentioned birthday, but still got that room.  Window looked out to a wall.  Mind you this isn't our first stay here.
plus^There was a lot of food available all over, but most was very pricey.
minus^We asked for an accessible room.  The location of the room was the farthest possible from the lobby.  A good 3 block walk to the end of the West Wing, dragging suitcases. Really bad choice for location of accessible rooms! It took 12 minutes to walk from our room to the lobby.
plus^Location,  staff,
minus^Didn't like that we were moved into north tower. The shower wasn't working well. Water was too hot or too cold, the mixture wasn't any good. Also, the drainage was very slow, so I stood in 3 in inches water. Pillows were not comfortable
plus^Location on strip was pretty good (Bellagio was much better)
minus^Staff were rude and abrasive at check-in King rooms were overbooked and despite being a booking genius and booking a long time in advance we were forced to fight to get the room we had booked West wing was awful - decor dated, could almost touch ceiling, definitely no more than 2* Drunks screaming in the corridor all night meant no sleep!
plus^Fantastic hotel with great facilities for the price, very attentive staff and great location with local bus stop outside the door. TV in the bathroom mirror a nice novelty.
minus^The occupants of the room next door who started the music and yelled and slammed doors from 6am till 8 am after partying all night. Kept taking their do not disturb sign as payback so house keeping would wake them at about 11am
plus^Hotel is OK but there are better ones on the strip that way cost less
minus^- Reception staff were not helpful at all - Wait time at reception for check-in or check-out too much - WiFi was terrible - Food and drinks on the property are way over-priced
plus^I like how everything was located in the hotel.Love the friendliness and knowledge of the staff.
minus^I wish I had chosen or really researched the different rooms instead of looking at the price of the rooms.
plus^I loved the location and the club hakkasan. I also like the variety of food places to eat inside the hotel. I will stay here again.
minus^Some of the dealers in the casino were rude.
plus^-Upgrade room types on higher floors are very good  -you can find food at every time of the day  -wi fi works very well
minus^-standard room was stinking and nevertheless the smell its depressing  -ventilation is noisy
plus^Nice Casino Blackjack tables in the whiskey bar Parking Staff
minus^Wifi connection very slow on the 11th floor Price for food and drinks really expensive inside 5$ for a coffee... I will understand it for a high class casino like Wynn but for the MGM...
minus^Nothing and never I go again  no hot water no heater .The curtain broken can't open to see the sun the safe box broken  the drainage on toilette not working  the shower broken  I spent all night calling the recipient for more then 6 hour promised to change the room never happen only at 6 am they ask me to go take shower in the gym different building because they have problems with heater system
plus^The staff at the MGM grand were very polite and friendly and very helpful, it was very clean and the hotel is located in a good spot on the strip, also the beds were extremely comfortable and the food is good.
minus^No bad experiences
plus^Quality and number of restaurants, room was very comfortable, very quiet.
minus^Booked through Booking.com; was not told that the room price would fluctuate from weekday to weekend. I thought the stated price would be the price.
minus^they sold our upgraded room for the first night. It is all on a first come bases no matter how you purchased or when you purchased. if you have a later flight the MGM as they did sold the king standard room upgrade. I even called the day of from Denver and spoke with Alan at the front desk he promised and di see my notes that we would be arriving late. The MGM took the money up front but still moved us to a over flow room due to there was a special event that night and room were sold out. they did not save us our room and sold it right out from under us and then tried to Comp their way out of everything wrong. our view was a concrete wall in the north tower for the first night. Bummer. kind of a come and get cha:(
plus^The location was great with the monorail connected to it and so many other good hotel spots. We took that to get around the most. The ka show was amazing, all the restaurants in the hotel were interesting and the Wolfgang bar and grills food was delicious!! The rooms were very nice and clean. The amount of slots and gambling was really big and so fun. 
minus^No complains 
plus^Lots of celebs walking around the hotel for the event we attended. Very clean & well attended to.  M Life rewards pay off in line ups & such. Great access to strip.
minus^Rep at check in was hard to understand and came off as unfriendly & uncaring. While at the buffet, one of the kitchen ladies started screaming while putting out food, it was some kind of bug!!! Lost our appetites very quickly :( We are from Canada so couldn't get used to inhaling secondhand smoke all weekend in the hotel, yuk! Some line ups for food can be long, or you pay a super high price elsewhere with no line ups. Food court didn't have much healthy selections.
plus^We like the size of shower
minus^did not really like that the bed covered the window and there's not a good view  Also, didn't  like that the door opened immediately to the restroom without having the bed out of sight.
plus^Nice room, much nicer than the cheaper hotels on the Strip.  Lots of food and restaurant options in the casino. Younger crowd in casino than other hotels.
minus^Thin walls in room - could hear annoying neighbors getting ready for their big night out
plus^lots of stuff to do
minus^the room has too many small light on all the electronic for night time the room was not vacuum for all our stay of 6 nights  a broken glass was put in the room as a clean glass.
plus^-Hakkasan (free entrance before 00:00 if staying in hotel)  -Cirque du Soleil show (Kà, must see!)  -Everything you can imagine is in the hotel -Good location on the strip
minus^-Location of elevators not practical; takes forever to get to the room -Room layout; entrance is in the bathroom -Staff not very welcoming, you're just another number
plus^The beds were very comfortable. Room was always clean and easy location on the strip. The hotel is massive with ever thing you need from casino to restaurants theatres etc
minus^The casino and hallways smelt funny probably because of smoke which I guess is to be expected staying in a casino
plus^Beds were comfy Hall ways were pretty quite for New Years. The casino was good but we liked New York new York a bit more when it came to casino.
minus^Our shower head didn't work. When we were checking in they said they had no rooms till 4 pm but if we paid 20$. More they had a room available, weird how that works.  Also, bring your own cord to plug in music. You have to pay 75$ for a box of cords
plus^The room was extremely clean and the bed was very comfortable. The staff were very friendly and catered to our every need.
minus^The casino itself was very smokey.  We have stayed at the MGM before and it has never been as bad as it was this year.
plus^It's classic Vegas. Seems to be just right for whatever it is you need. The food is top notch. Very fun place to be.
minus^The gym closes at 7pm which is silly by any measure.they have a cardio room on 4th floor which seems to make it even more silly.i hope the hours of gym change because that's searious to a lot of people. I would expect more from a hotel like that.
plus^I loved the location it was central to all the venues and short taxi rides to the night clubs. The resturants and bars inside the casino were classy and nice.
minus^Our room was small and stuffy. It had no window outlook and became claustrophobic after a while. We also did not receive any room cleaning the whole 4 days we were there so our room was quite messy. I think bottles of water in the room would have been nice.
plus^Proximity to airport and The Strip. Fantastic excursions to Grand canyon, Death Valley and Mountains of Fire  So glad you included resort tax
minus^Too much smoke and noise unavoidable in Vegas
plus^Location
minus^The attitude of the staff was just bad. Wallpaper pealing in room.  25% of lights in room out.  Paint pealing off vents in room.  No hot water at times. Staff indifference to guest was the biggest neg.
minus^We had a late check in and out reserved and paid for room had been given away. Therefore we were stuck in a room that was horrible. The room was above heavy construction the tv didn't work and their remedy was to move us to another
plus^The room size
minus^Despite requesting 6 months in advance, making reservation for 5 DBLB rooms, none were facing the strip. Had even called thrice before the arrival date but of no use. No coffee/tea maker in the room was charged US$35 for the same quite oppositie to 5 star norms.
minus^Great Restaurants, Best Dance Nightclub in town Hakkasan; the biggest EDM DJs in the world are residents here. SPA is awesome. Pool is awesome. Pool Party: Wet Republic. Very comfortable room.
plus^The hotel rooms were clean and had comfortable beds. Nice looking hotel. Good staff.
minus^Noise level from the small airport was very loud.  Location of the hotel was further away from other hotels.
plus^The hotel was close to everything and had lots of food options inside. Good casino and very clean!
minus^No weight room, only a cardio room. Whatever fragrance is used to help with the smokey smell was offensive and made the smell worse.
plus^The photo booth and the different types of restaurants. Also how the people parked the cars for us and the show there was a lot of space inside the hotel
minus^I didn't like how you guys did not have a refrigerator. Also I didn't like the wait for our cars to get to us.
plus^Pillows and mattress were great! The wifi is good. The hotel is very well located to enjoy the crazy Las Vegas, plus always has great shows within the facility!
minus^The staff was correct, the room good but a little outdated for this rate. We also expected a bathroom more comfortable, with better quality towels and gels.
minus^Classic five star, very spacious, well appointed room, got a free upgrade, easy check in and check out, metro goes through the MGM- so very convenient
plus^Great location, close to airport and RTC bus station, easy to get all the destinations on strip. Room is spacious, well designed and comfort, good sound proof and free wifi is nice.
minus^Big hotel, too big... Easy to get lost when you first come and path to rooms will be miles... Air in the casino is vey bad, tables and slot machines are crowded...not like other hotel with comfortable space between.
plus^From the second we arrived we were treated like the only people there, everything we needed there was someone willing to help and all the facilities were immaculate, i loved my stay and will definatly be returning again.
minus^my trip was too short
plus^Great hotel, lots of options for food, great location (from airport and the strip), spacious room, free self parking and wifi available
minus^Smoking smell throughout the hotel public areas (people smoke in every casino in Vegas), expensive amenities, may experience loud people during the night
plus^MGM is centrally located on the strip with plenty of restaurants, bars and gaming located nearby. The Hakasan night club is epic when it hosts top Dj's. Bed and room were nice and big shower was a plus. Discount tickets to the magical KA show too.
minus^The hotel is actually a little too big. There is large waits to check out and when walking to rooms the corridors seem to go on forever and almost seem like a mirror reflection but it's not. Consequently getting around takes a while and you constantly have to walk through the gaming area and deal with the indoor smokers
plus^Variety of restaurants/entertainment including Hakkasan and David Copperfield. MGM has some nice rooms (not this one!) Location good.
minus^Room basic (e.g. no minibar). No hot water Shower flooded Lonnng walk down a corridor to get to room 15 minute walk to open pool at the Signature.
minus^Room was like a prison cell with one window overlooking a dark alley.Wifi was very slow and television kept freezing picture because of dropping signal. Electronic checkout was inop. $36 resort was hidden charge not disclosed at time of booking. i travel over 200K airmiles a year.This is worst hotel in 10yrs of travel
plus^Great location,  Free WiFi,  Many restaurants, Friendly staff
minus^Relatively small room with strange layout. You are in the bathroom when you enter the room.  Slow WiFi but acceptable. Long walk to the room. It took me about 5 minutes to get from the elvator to the room.
plus^It's clean.
minus^Although the room appears to be cheap, everything else isn't. Food and drink prices are exorbitant, but that's what you expect in Las Vegas.
plus^The hotel has everything you need. The Hakkasan, the Casino, great restaurants, and a huge arena that accommodates concerts. The location is close to the bus stop which is great if you wanna travel to other places.  The staff at the concierge office were extremely helpful and helped us find our way everywhere and get tickets to all the events we wanted to go to.
minus^it was extremely expensive during NYE. It's a bit far from the other big hotels like Ceasars palace and WYNN Be careful as my phone got stolen from my purse at the Hakkasan one busy night and i never found it. I reported it but they didn't seem to care much about my problem and all they said was we didn't get anything at the lost & found.
plus^Room size, location is good as well as price.
minus^The hot water in the shower was a bit ordinary, couldn't get a good water temp, it was either to hot or to cold and adjusting it bit by bit didn't make a difference.
plus^Room was spacious, clean & bed was very comfortable in West tower
minus^No view in our room Restaurants onsite had poor service & high prices for the value
plus^upgrade to king suite was the right decision
minus^layout is not as good as some of newer hotels originally put us in old part, low floor and smelly w/ mold. paid for an upgrade and got a King Suite on 19th floor, was much better.  like dining options at other hotels better.
plus^I loved the cleanliness of the rooms and how friendly all the staff members were including housekeeping.  The resturants were very convienent and had great variety-
minus^The  booze was soooo spendy :) 24$ for a tall vodka/cranberry
minus^Front desk check went an extra step in asking if my reason for coming was the concert and when I replied yes she made sure to give me the custom concert artist room keys. An extra touch that was much appreciated.
minus^This is the best hotel we've stayed in and when we come back to Las vegas we will stay here again. Go for the suite, the extra space is great. The whirlpool bath gave us a great bath. The room service is very good and for us Brits did include Tea!! which was lovely. If you were that way inclined, you'd never have to leave this hotel, it has everything on site! I really liked the atmosphere of this hotel and would definitely stay again.
minus^Very rude and inflexible check in / reservation staff.... We booked for nye and we got delayed in severe snow and dint arrive until the next morning. .. We rang ahead to ask them to keep the room as we might have been in overnight which they promised to do... but when we arrived after 24 hours driving at 10 am we were told they'd given our room away but still charged us! There was no human kindness even. And when we asked to extend as we needed 2 nights we were given full rate prices and no offers / compromise ... not a hotel who cares about its people or who can offer any dynamic or reps onside service. Very disappointing. Bar staff were also rude and unwelcoming even as hotel guests once it got busy in the evenings.
minus^Overall, our experience with this hotel was good and would like to stay again in our future visit.  We will highly recommend this hotel to our relatives and friends if they want to visit Vegas!
plus^- Grandeur of the place - major shows running in the premises - walking distance from all major attractions  - great food options - express checkout through mobile/sms
minus^- limited bell services with most of them busy both during checkin/checkout, had to manage our luggage in/out of the room ourselves and the room was faaaaaar away in the west wing - hot water wasnt the best.. ran out after 15 mins of shower
plus^everything is here! casino, entertainment, monorail, cirque du soleil, food!!
minus^maybe a hotel in the middle of the strip was better. mgm grand is at the one end of the strip, but thats just a minor nitpick
plus^The view was great, big room/bathroom & convenient location.
minus^No free WiFi, paid $20 for early check in, curt (but also very busy) staff & argued over our Booking.com booking price.
minus^Rate bookings.com stated was different than what mgm charged me - and mgm staff said I would have to resolve with bookings.com. I'll never stay at an mgm facility again. 
plus^The way the hotel smelled! The room was excellent! The price was Fair!! the restaurant's were outstanding The location is great, especially when you have teenagers.
minus^The extra deposit, but after a while I understood and they refunded me back.
plus^I took my 11 year old. We loved location. Monorail station in hotel to access strip. Room spacious. Great view. Staff helpful. We had a $75 budget, couldn't afford restaurants, it's was $25 for a coffee, croissant & juice in Starbucks! Ate at food court basic, cheap.  Walgreens not far to stock up on water etc. they ask for a $300 deposit for incidentals.
minus^Non smoking room but still very smoky in the hotel. Not ideal for asthma. Tipping can be expensive on a budget. Buy show tickets at Txts4u on strip not in hotel for bigger discounts. Pool was closed but said open on line!
minus^The service was very great from the front desk personnel, housekeeping, restaurants, valet people are fast & good! The hotel is beautiful & clean!! Great place to stay at when in Las Vegas! Beautiful facilities!
plus^Wolfgang puck bar and grill - food is outstanding, efficient team with friendly service and great drinks menu. I would bother going trying the buffets which focused in quantity and not quality.
minus^Stayed in a standard king room and it was underwhelming for a Vegas hotel to say the very least.  No coffee or tea making facility and there wasn't even a shower cap in the bathroom! Walk to the hotel room was even more ridiculous. It felt like we were trying to find a room at a hospital rather than at a hotel - they are sectioned into various wings which seemed a bit disconnected to the rest of the hotel. It felt grim! The smell of smoke around the premise was also disgusting but to be fair, this is a problem across many hotels in Vegas!
minus^No tea/coffee making equipment in the room. Room lacked a few minor items the cleaners shod have ensured were there(hand soap/light bulb/do not disturb sign!). Resort fee in Winter is outrageous as the pool area is closed and they charge $25 per day to use the gym/spa! It's a stealth tax by another name!
plus^Location is good to all other hotels. The whole hotel is really big. Room has a good view of the Las Vegas Blv. Bed is comfort. Staff are friendly. Good experience to stay in such grand hotel.
minus^The bathroom is sperated into two small rooms. Room is smaller than I think.
plus^You don't need to go out of the hotel. It has everything !! Free parking included.
minus^Apparently there is another section in the hotel where the rooms are smaller, with one small window and cold corridors. We were given a such a room without knowing.
plus^I really loved almost everything in the hotel
minus^The room rates is different from day to another and it doesnt show in my advanced reservation when i did and it made a big differance in total amount in my 6 nights staying in the hotel
plus^Rooms are very nice and valuable (weekdays)
minus^Special perfume smell in all public areas Pool closed (main reason for chosing this hotel) Hotel is a labyrinth, difficult to navigate Tower Spa Suite without Bathrobe. Shower armatures fellt off during visit.
minus^We stayed there for 3 nights or 4 days. Its my 2nd time in Vegas. I decided to use this hotel because i'm with my kids. I would say the room really excellent. I requested for 2 queen size bed but its' subject for additional fee of $80 but because of the magic word PLEASE the receptionist gave us for foc except for $20 for an early check in. Highly recommended. Definitely going back for my next time to visit us. 
plus^There were a lot of restaurants to choose from. Also, easy access to Las Vegas strip.
minus^Everything horribly overpriced. Staff treats you like just another number. Really impersonal touch to everything.
plus^Location  facilities  Specious room
minus^Reseption staff was rud and kept me waiting for more than an hour, also i stayed for 5 days and they cleaned my room only once.
minus^Easy to move from one hotel and casino to the others and everyone at the reception is very friendly. Had a good stay with my friend and enjoy ourselves a lot.
plus^+ Perfect room for perfect price + $30 breakfast / lunch buffet is not the best quality at all for that price - would have expected a better quality + personnal seemed to be friendly and helpful
minus^- Shows are a way too expensive (eg. Copperfield) - No discounts for Hotel guests .. even with playing cards
plus^Facilities brilliant. Good location.
minus^Paying a resort fee of 200 plus dollars and only staying for three nights is excessive. You do get it back however but it is too much for three nights.
plus^the luciousness of it all
minus^the clientel were more down market than i would have xpected - dress code reflected a somewhat disrespectful society; or to puy it anoyher way at my age and standing i was in the wrong hotel.
minus^MGM is one of the legendery hotels at Vegas. MGM Grand is realy GRAND! You can find amazing shows. it has great casino. I stayed at king suite. I realy love the place.
plus^I enjoyed the Wellness ammenities such as the vitamin infused shower, the cleanliness of the room, as well as the nice aroma within the hallways.
minus^I wish that there was a refrigerator in the room.
minus^Like the location, friendly staff, plush room, top cleanliness, checking in was a breeze, as well as checking out, big plus fact that MGM did not have that cigarette smell, that usually gets me sick, we were very happy with our stay, definitely would stay here again.
plus^Very comfortable room, excellent location.
minus^Because the hotel is so big, it would be very helpful to have a more accurate floor plan map available for first-time visitors.  We finally found the exit from the west wing to the strip at the end of our third and last day -- had we been told about it, we could have saved a lot of time getting to and from our room.  We met two other mature couples who had the same problem.  Unnecessary walking can be a problem for us older folks.  Please put the exit on the map, or at least tell older people about it when they check in.
plus^Staff was helpful and competent.
minus^Don't count of a good night sleep when the double glazing is no match for a constant flow of planes and helicopters.
plus^Plenty of choice on eating places.  Good access to other Hotels
minus^We stayed in the West Wing which is in need of updating.  No Lions.  If you do not arrive by Taxi it is not obvious where the check in is and you have to traipse through the Casino with suitcases.  Signs very confusing and not obvious enough. Staff at the Hotel were not very friendly.  Lights in our room did not work and response for repair was very slow once we actually located a number to ring.
plus^The property is beautiful and has everything you could ask for. We ate at multiple restaurants, went to the Spa and Salon, gambled, and went to a concert. It was all great and there's really no need to leave!
minus^Half of the staff that we encountered had a really upsetting attitude.
plus^Nothing
minus^Cleaning bad, they have very bad room has an old furniture when I checked in they show me and asked me if I didn'n like it I have to upgrade it and pay more than Its written in booking. Even the fees and charges they have hidden charge not written in booking.com when you got to the hotel you will surprise in your invoices. Veypry huge hotel I lost inside it manytimes. If you want to ask for the bellman you have to wait about 30 mins! If you want to call the operator you will wait from 5-7 mins to answer you. If you asked for adapter they don't have you have to buy from the store down in the lobby. The room doesn't have sound insulator you will hear the room beside it and it will be noisy
plus^The view and room was really nice.
minus^Even in the upgraded suite we stayed in for our honeymoon, there was no refrigerator or microwave. They will provide a refrigerator for $25/day. Room service and minibar prices were the highest I've ever seen. There are many places with better value on the Las Vegas strip and I'd advise against choosing MGM Grand as a first option.
plus^Location on the strip, it's cheap to stay at. Aircon very good; nice view of strip.
minus^Very dry air meant we were getting big static shocks after walking down the long carpeted corridors. The place smells bad. Takes about 5 minutes to get to the entrance from the room so don't forget something in the room!
plus^Location Plenty of options for eating, drinking & entertainment.
minus^Bathroom was a little bit busted, sealant on the doors was loose and light switch was not working.
plus^the casino is big and the location
minus^almost everything . first of all without any notification when you book. they send me to the west tower too far from the main building  far from the the hotel lobby . small room , you have to walk like 15 mints to get to your room, even i paid the same price to be in the main tower . i'll not came back again , even if it will be for free
plus^The queen size room was very nice.
minus^I booked two rooms, 1 standard king size and 1 deluxe queen. The deluxe queen was great. The standard king was a disappointment. Way to small, the bed felt like a rolll down futon and the window blind could not be open because of the giant 2 green lights shinning on the building. The shower was a normal shower (tubless) and the doors felt like they were going to fall apart. I thought that THE M.G.M WAS BETTER THEN THAT, I could have found that kind of room on one of those smaller off the strip motels !Last but not least, the T.V. kept loosening the cable feed to the stations to both rooms
plus^Spa Tower suite.  Great view.  Dream tub.  To die for pillows.   Ambient lounge tv selection.
minus^Early check in was a comedy of errors.   Room wasn't available.   Had been adviced this could happen.    Then they found a room.  Wrote down wrong number so returned to desk.  Right room was still inhabitted.   Given temporary room for one hour it was four.  Kind of ruined my plans for the day and reason for hotel stay.
minus^When I arrived late for my check-in I was informed that there were no single king rooms left.  I was then upgraded to one of the suites.  I am very thankful to the kind staff for making our night!
plus^The Grand Buffett was very good. Great veggies! Room was quiet. Staff friendly. Good monorail location. Nice bathroom.  Room big enough for 3 women!
minus^pillows were too fat and too firm
plus^The staff was excellent, very helpful. The location was good.
minus^This was my first time visiting Las Vegas, and the MGM; however for the price I didn't see what the hype was about. The rooms were very small, and I always felt I was in a maze just to get around the hotel. My brother stayed another hotel on the strip and his room was way bigger, very stylish and for a lesser value.
minus^We were upgraded to the Wellness Floor for $17 by the hotel. The room was all designed around wellness from bed to lights to air. We loved it and if ever back in Vegas will specifically book room on this floor.
plus^Great space in room. Executive Queen is well laid out. Lots of restaurants. Great evening entertainment. Cirque du Soleil Ka is resident there.
minus^The smoking. The public areas are filled with smokers with no smoke free areas. For that reason I would not go back.
plus^Location - right on the strip.
minus^The room was next to a ventilation station and was quite noisy during the night when everything is quiet. another thing is I was surprised people can smoke in the sports betting hall... Non of the night clubs in the hotel was open on Monday and Tuesday.
plus^I was very upset about the hidden fees assessed after making reservations with the online service. I would never do that again. The extra hidden fees were over $100
minus^Finding out about these fees after I had arrived
plus^Room was great - big room, big bathroom, always clean, nothing broken. 2 TVs, WiFi for 4 devices and works in whole hotel even in conference center. USB charging in room was good for European travelers - no need to use adapter to charge devices. There are separate floors for smoking and non-smoking visitors.
minus^I booked bigger room, but got smaller one (but even smaller one was great :) )
plus^- Great pools - Nice rooms
minus^- The Gym is fair, not good.  (No weights, only erobic exercise machines) - A little expensive, espacially in the weekends.
plus^Casino & restaurants. MLife staff excellent. Very accommodating & helpful.  Wonderful shops. Overall, a good experience.
minus^Remote control for television. Selection of channels.
plus^Clean
minus^Booking.com gave me one price and when I checked out it was a total different amount plus they offer early check in for an extra charge that they didn't tell me until I checked out!!
plus^The restaurants and casino
minus^The room which could be compared to a shoe box.  Phone didn't work. The door to the bathroom. Incredibly small bathroom. Mike long walk to the room
minus^I specifically reserved a queen suite with 2 beds as I was traveling with my girlfriends on my 30th birthday. However they were unable to accommodate that and gave us only one bed. 3 girls with one bed?? My friend had to sleep on the uncomfortable sofa bed and woke up hurting the next day. I can't believe that in that massive hotel there was not one suite with 2 beds. Upgrade? No. Downgrade? Sure but I would've paid the same price as the King suite. I spoke with the staff 3 different times about this and they were unable to accomodate us. But they waived the resort fees. Big whoop. The room was nice, but I am dissapointed and I will not be going back.
plus^The staff, the amenities, the location, the shows, the restaurants, etc
minus^My room was very small, it was well kept and nice, but very small.  It wasn't what I expected - WEST WING.
plus^It was very easy to get anything we needed. From tickets to anything more for the room. Having the monorail right there was incredibly convenient. MGM is at the prime location for anything you may want to do. Always easy access. The best part was when we first arrived we parked at the back self parking tower by the rental cars, and the gentleman in security near it, by the monorail, made our first experience amazing. Because we had a child he let us in the back way (the emergency exit by monorail) So we didn't have to walk on the street. He proceeded to then give us a miniature tour and direct us to check-in. Even suggesting the best places to eat inside the MGM. He truly had the best customer service, and he was security! Overall it made my wife's first experience something to talk about forever. We will be coming back.
minus^The valet staff drove our car in to the pickup area like they were in a race with each other. I will say though, that our guy must have won! Halls often has trash from the guests that weren't picked up for the entire 3 days that we were there.
plus^Clean hotel. Friendly staff. Good facilities. Food court and shops at the bottom. On the strip
minus^TV kept turning on by itself. Shower head was horrible. Told the staff about it and they did not charge us the hotel resort fees.
plus^The MGM was very convenient. Easy to get to and with the tram was easy to get around right there at the begining.
minus^The only gripe I had was it was very noisy in my room with people dropping stuff in a dumpster all night in the little walkway below my room. That made it a very stressfull stay trying to get some rest from being at sema all day.
plus^The hotel was very clean and the location was great.
minus^Long walk to the room. The hotel is huge. I also didn't like that I have to sometimes wait 45 min in the que to get a cab.
plus^Good location Good clean & comfortable room Quiet in your room Lots of facilities
minus^No Tea/Coffee Making in room Upon arrival there was a fight with 2 young people in reception
plus^Excellent hotel if you want to push the boat out expense wise, clean, modern, 1842 Bar/restaurant excellent food and good prices, staff at each department of hotel very nice and helpfull.
minus^Tap bar very expensive and no deals or happy hour very strange as every other place on the strip are mad for happy hours. Bit pricey with the resort fee and taxes its an extra $50 a night on what your paying, didnt like that. Paying more for the name of the place - cheaper hotels in better locations
plus^We got free early check-in, the room was fantastic and comfortable and very clean. There was not an ounce of dust anywhere - it was spotless! The bed was huge and comfy. There's free parking and free wifi. The location of the hotel is great. They held our luggage after check-out for free. Would stay here again!
minus^We had to stand in line for about 60 minutes to check in.
plus^I love the location of the hotel. The staff was very kind.
minus^I did not like the fact , the hotel did not have a refrigerator,  or microwave in the room . When I asked about a refrigerator I was told housekeeping would pick up and return refrigerator items for a $25.00 fee, and there was absolutely no microwaves available.  The bed was itching my fiance & I. When I returned  home I noticed two large  whelps on my back in result to a massive  mark &constant itching.
plus^Everything apart from the choking cigarette smoke in the casino and the perfumed air they use to try to disguise it. Horrible.
minus^The choking cigarette smoke in the casino and the perfumed air they use to try to disguise it. Horrible.
minus^The casino area is the biggest of the strip, and the pool at wet republic party was very good, the other thing is that had everything you need at the same hotel.
plus^I loved the location of the hotel you could walk every where.
minus^I disliked the fact that at night you have to fight to get through large groups of people that are going to the night club and where my room was I heard a lot of loud people outside the hotel
plus^The Hecho Mexican restaurant is amazing.  Hotel location good.  Pools are fantastic especially the flow pool, plenty of seating and towels available.
minus^We paid more for an Executive King room but the view was absolutely terrible, couldn't see the point in paying more for a fabulous huge room with such a disappointing view, our friends who paid much less for the Deluxe King room had an amazing view of the Strip - we ended up using our friends room even though they didn't have an entertaining area to meet up in before dinner as their room was much more pleasant, ours also had minimal lights while theirs was lovely and bright! HUGE lines to check-in or out, for luggage storage and even for taxis, much more staff needed on the desks.  Also after lining up so long to check in we were told our room wasn't available even though we were nearly 3 hours after check-in started, after a lengthy discussion with a manager one magically appeared - think we were shafted though as mentioned above the room was a big disappointment.
plus^Good choice of restaurants.
minus^Constant very loud music at pool complex. Totally inappropriate duga-duga (ie dance) played at near illegal decibel levels at all of the pools so no getting away from it. Made comments to Manager types & while they said they appreciated the feedback they really did not seem interested. Won't be staying here again.
plus^Its on the strip and has nice shows
minus^My room was at the end of the 400m hallways and there was no view only one window which was behind the bed didnt actually like it. I will never book a small room again, when asked to change the said theyre all booked.  Again this makes me question the integrity of booking.com as this is my second bad experience when booking with booking.com
plus^Got an upgrade to a better room free of charge. Hotel was a resort in itself, wouldn't have to leave if you didn't want to.
minus^Took about half an hour to check in as there was a huge queue. Music around the pool was a bit annoying
plus^Great room with incredibly comfortable bed and excellent shower. Hotel has everything you'd expect and more!
minus^No complaints but at the price should be  good things
plus^*The hotel is really huge and nice to have a walk inside it,  *the rooms were clean  *there are nice shops at the hotel,  *the monorail starts from this hotel which is an advanced point for MGM if you cant walk the strip
minus^* The room service was really bad and not up to satisfaction * I found a small spider in my bed before heading to sleep * the location is almost at beginning of the strip
plus^Great value. Clean, nice, modern hotel with fantastic facilities. Pleasant, fresh scent around the hotel (Vanilla?).
minus^Long check in queue, took about 45 mins to finally reach the check in desk.
plus^MGM is a good hotel for the money you pay, excellent nightclub and good location. Nice pools and lots going on
minus^Walking so far around it it's so big !
plus^The interior of the hotel is fantastic and the lobby entrance is impressive. The staff upon check in were very helpul and proffesional. Housekeeping were also very good and kept our room emaculate througout our stay.
minus^I had to make a phonecall back to the UK. Although i appreciate that international phonecalls cost more I felt that $112 for a short phonecall was outrageous especially as I had made a similar phonecall in Washington D.C the previous week at a fraction of the cost. This made for a rather unpleasant suprise upon check out.
plus^Upgraded to a double suite.
minus^We had to queue for half-an-hour in a cattle pen to check in. Than we found they had lost our booking and had to wait 15 minutes while the not-very-friendly clerk went away to sort it out. We got upgraded to a very good double suite. Later we tried to get on the internet but the clerk hadn't checked us in properly so I had to queue all over again to re-check in! On checking out, they tried to charge  us twice because we'd checked in twice. Not good!
plus^Handy to lot of locations and lot of walking
minus^Staff were disrespectful and if you ask any directions they just say NO to everything . Very bad experience
plus^This is a convenient location at the very south end of the strip. The modern room and choice of restaurants & shows was great. We saw Cirque's Ka and it was outstanding - worth the expensive ticket price! 
minus^This hotel is laid out in a manner that forces you to walk forever to get to rooms or activities in the hotel. We had a room that seemed to be in the middle of the only 2 elevators that service this massive complex! If you forgot anything in your room, you were in for at least a 5 minute walk. Also, because it is such a big hotel, finding the parking garage and other services was quite an endeavor. I kept thinking that the woman in front of me during check-in was wearing way too much perfume, but... They pump strongly perfumed air throughout the main floor of the complex, so you can't escape it! 
plus^Perfect location on the strip and a nice casino within the hotel.
minus^We were placed in a smoking room without asking our preference. Cigarette burns on the carpet. Long lines for check-in and check-out.
minus^When people walk down the hallway talking it's sounded like they were in the room with us. Also the bed was broken and noisy. For the amount of money we paid to stay the room was inadequate. Why would we consider staying here again. I feel like I got ripped off of a great weekend experience.
minus^Rooms were great, Pools are amazing. Very Busy. Has a buzz about it. Rainforest Café has the most beautiful breakfasts.  I would definitely recommend it.
plus^nice rooms, great price. Lots of amenities.
minus^layout of hotel made it hard to find restaurants and food. Buffet was was overpriced and had to wait an over an hour most days. A little disappointed the welcome to Vegas store was closed.
minus^They will overcharge you after and scam you, demanding more money. If you refuse, they will send your name to collections and try to damage your credit. Avoid this fraudulent company.
plus^It's has lot going on and always stuff to do. Poor area is amazing. Rooms are modern and can't fault cleanliness. Shear size of the hotel and a lot of people staying here.
minus^Waited a long time at information and key desk when my key didn't work. Only had one person on and was waiting over 20 minutes for a quick 10 second update on my key. Concierge service was not on main lobby area so struggled to get information, some of the oter hotels are better at this.
plus^Easy check-out
minus^The casino was pure smoke from cigarettes the hall to my room looked out of date they did not receive my request to check in early so instead they gave me a room on the first floor with no view the buffet was nothing compared to the high reviews I thought it sucked
plus^Our room was large and tastefully decorated, the bathroom was 5 star.  Comfortable beds with quality linens.  Easy free self parking.
minus^The hotel is enormous.  The check in area felt like an airport.
plus^(Tower suite) * Very comfortable bed * Very large room * Very nice bathroom with separate shower and bath * Free parking
minus^* Noise from outside (10th floor)
plus^Hotel quality, accommodation...
minus^They had a problem with price from Booking.com . They wanted to charge 175 USD instead of 75 USD. I spent 1 hour with negotiation....
plus^The lobby was nice, the pool's were ok. The monorail station was a good touch.
minus^The room I was put in was in a bit of a state of disrepair, peeling wallpaper, incorrectly fitted toilet door, dirty carpets and shower. The staff were ok, but nothing special. The place was EXPENSIVE!!! Bring a lot of money, especially if you want a drink, or to eat there. Some of the staff were rude to my friends. So, overall, I would not bother.
plus^Good restaurants.
minus^Really bad bed( if you can call it that). We had coupons for some eateries in the district, but when we wanted to use them the hallway was blocked off because they were filming something. It's so large it was a lot of walking to get around.
minus^Room is great and super comfortable. Pool is nice and spacious.
plus^Location
minus^We booked a tower suite with a king bed and ended up having go sleep in two separate beds because we were told there were no kings aND we were given 2 queens instead which were a lot smaller than a queen size bed. Then we were offered birthday champagne and it never arrived. Very disappointed with mgm
plus^The room was great and the pool area fantastic
minus^This hotel is so big that it takes 10 minutes just to get to the front door. The food in the restaurants was mass produced and too expensive for what it was.
plus^Fantastic room (spa suite), comfortable and quiet. great location on strip.
minus^Noise everywhere, crowded pool area, facilities like a shopping mall. Vegas
plus^My wife and I stayed here on the last week of our honeymoon. Rooms were fantastic, we had a great view if the strip and were upgraded at reception by just asking the guy for a room with a view. Concierge was excellent and gave us discounted tickets when we went
minus^Restaurants are expensive- two new pubs opened in the MGM which are very expensive to eat and drink at for above average food. Better going outside to eat and drink.
plus^The hotel is very well located and is one of the biggest in LV, with many events, restaurants and gambling.
minus^You have to wait in line 20 minutes for check in and check out. You cannot use the minibar for personal items.
plus^The staff were excellent, I managed to leave my mobile phone in the room and the housekeeping team did everything possible to get it back to me.
minus^We were travelling with a 19 year old family member who wasnt often allowed to sit in a bar with us even though he wasnt having any alcohol. I appreciate this would be the same in all the hotels but it did impact our ability to enjoy the facilities.
minus^The hotel is spotless , amazing beds , the hotel is huge ..if you don't want to you don't have to leave the hotel for days! Love the fact wet republic is just inside the hotel ! 10 out of 10 !
plus^The room with spa that's amazing, we do love it, and also big room is staying for relax.
minus^Spa is too dirty, I try use my nail clean it, it works, hope next time better.
plus^Clean Good bedrooms
minus^Smoking inside (applies to all state hotels I guess) Poor service in bars & restaurants Overly large and crowded Unclear signage
plus^The location was great, the strip was easily accessed from MGM
minus^We weren't able to check in until 4.30 because the room wasn't ready, explaining this was because guest are given the opportunity to purchase an extended check out so rooms are not always ready by 3pm. When we did get to the room I was disappointed, I expected more from the MGM, it had not been cleaned well, still rubbish in the bin from the last guest and toothpaste marks in the sink. It was generally dated and worn. The 'resort fee' $28 a day is to cover things like wifi. The wifi was shockingly poor.
plus^Staff were all terrific from check in to valets to guys who took care of our bags, choices for entertainment and ease of access to all of it - and we found a great restaurant, (crush) right downstairs. Overall we had a great time and would come stay again next year when we come for our next conference.
minus^Wish the pool was open earlier, maybe later.  Rooms were more than adequate, but expected a little more, especially because we were upgraded. Beds were very comfy but the pillows were terrible.
plus^Fantastic place to stay. Small room with limited view but grat value. Huge place with everything you need I walking distance. Great pool area.
minus^Be aware, may be a long walk from elevator to your room!
plus^The location was good
minus^No coffee making faculties and the whole casino reeks of smoke it chokes u, go to the mirage it always smells fantastic so do most if the others , hotel is a bit dated aswel in the furnishings
minus^We didn't get the room choice we booked and I had a hideous experience in the very overpriced spa. Checking out was a nightmare as they were trying to charge us a no show fee even though we checked in on time.  Don't know what everyone is raving about, staff couldnt care less about your stay. Very disappointed.
plus^STAFF POOLSIDE FURISHINGS SIZE OF ROOM THINGS TO DO VALUE FOR MONEY NO SMOKING ROOM
minus^EXPENSIVE TO EAT/DRINK IN SOME PLACES VERY BUSY AT CHECK IN/OUT NO PERSONAL FRIDGE
plus^Nice Big Room & Bathroom, Good Fixtures & Fittings. Ideal Location On The Strip!
minus^Perhaps I'm A Little Naive, But I Was  Disappointed To Find Smoking Allowed In The Casino And Even Though We Had A NO SMOKING Room The Smell Still Pervaded There. Room 4558 Was At Least Half A Mile From Reception.  The Queue For Booking In Was Huge And Took About 25 Minutes. Taxes And Resort Fees Account For About Another 50%, Food And Services In The Hotel Very Expensive.  In Brief If You Don't Like Gambling And Smoking, Find Yourselves A Small Hotel With No Casino. Vegas Itself Was Amazing!
plus^Comfortable beds and fun casino.  The pool area was amazing
minus^Our shower head did not work well at all and our view was horrible.  Workers walked back and forth in front of our window many times.
plus^Good facilities, clean, ease of checkout, friendly staff at check in.Room was big and nice--though the decorations weren't great.  Casino's seats were comfortable.  Some nice restaurants.
minus^We were in a suite on the 4th floor.  Our view was trashcans and the service truck depot.  At 5 in the morning-the clatter of trash being picked up woke us up.  Even though we had a suite, there was no coffeepot or useable frig though there was a dining table. Didn't care for the decor.  Would recommend anyone staying to ask for floors 8 and up.
plus^Everything, hotel is just AMAZING, we had a suite and the views are amazing too. We went and looked a the other top hotels and not one compared to the MGM...we will be back :) :) Great location and prices are very reasonable..loved every minute and we both was sad to leave
minus^NOTHING to not like
plus^Not much to like. The rooms were nice and very clean. Not very sound proof however.
minus^Check in took 45 minutes. Pillows on bed weighed 5 pounds each and hard as a rock  This hotel was so busy it was like trying to walk through Times Square on New Years Eve.
plus^Beautifull pool, great facilities, nice rooms, good housekeeping, true vegas feel.
minus^The hotel is extremely big which gives it a kind of unpersonal feel. However this is the Vegas style so you know what you are getting into. Prices for food and drinks are expensive(but also a vegas problem not mgm)
plus^Nice hotel huge
minus^They didn't have our room ready, 2 hours later they gave us a room & it was occupied had to get on security phone to get another room wasn't happy front desk person was very nice.
plus^Large comfy bed Many restaruants Large pool area Close to many other hotels Easy to navigate Helpful staff
minus^Long lines upon check-in Smoky in casino area/air freshener overpowering in hallways and lobbies Noise at night Long lines to get cabs
minus^This hotel is really huge, we walked to our room over 3 minutes through corridor! Everything is old. Room is tiny, casino/lobby/hotel has low ceiling and it is claustrophobic. Food is bad. Hotel is in a worse part of Strip. It is dirty, full of chip stores with strange people. NOT RECOMMEND.
plus^The stay was nice, as the room was clean and quiet 
minus^There were not enough choices in the hotel or immediate area for reasonable restaurants with affordable prices (fast food excluded). Spending $25 for a hamburger meal or $15 for an omlette plate are not affordable to most clients. There are some fast food choices and nearly all high end restaurants, but nothing in the middle for your average client. 
plus^The location was good Lazy river
minus^Overly smokey casino, overpriced cocktails, nearly £15.00 each. Positioning of air conditioning unit in room (right next to your head when you are in bed), lift positioning in the rooms section, had to walk the full length of a very long corridor and then walk completely back on ourselves to get to the room.  Takes over 10 minutes to walk to the room from reception, god forbid to forget your sunglasses!  The casino was quite in your face compared to others on the strip.  Noisy people in the corridors at all silly times.
plus^I appreciated the willingness of staff to accommodate our needs.  I enjoyed the new room.  Breakfast in the coffee shop had a nice light menu.  Wolfgang Puck's, although noisy, had wonderful and very tasty lunch options.
minus^I was totally dissatisfied with the room that we were assigned.  The carpets in the hall were old and soiled.  The carpet in the room appeared to not have been swept thoroughly.  The deco was like a room I would imagine on a moon walk.  Also,  the walk from the central elevators was WAY too far for my husband who has mobility issues. I called to get another room and was graciously accommodated by the receptionist.  The room was in the remodeled tower and was $20 more per night which was well worth the increase.
plus^everything except the minibar and the waiting time when calling the frontdesk or the housekeeping services.
minus^mini bar policy (mentionned on a small sticker that no one would really see): 50 dollar fine if you use the minibar to store personal items. any item removed from the mini bar  even temporarily is charged. still have to contact the property to get my 288 dollar back due to mini bar policy
plus^Checkout on TV. Room and shower.
minus^Signs to Parking not clearly visible at night. Wifi reception in the room not available or very poor. Complex too large.
plus^Central location
minus^Too big. Took over 40 minutes to check in. Then a long walk to find our room had not been cleaned. Then another 30 minute wait while they found us a different room. Computer system down when we checked out and had to follow up phone call to get bill corrected.
plus^After a heavy night you will be looking for a decent rest in the sun. Rooms are great and its not that commercial as the other hotels althoufh it mifht sound crazy but MGM was good. We moved to try other hotels as well but next time will go back to MGM - no wifi limitations ! Lots of su  aa many pools are in the shadow their buildings.
minus^Nothing
plus^Everything was great except for one problem which I will tell you about.
minus^The line for check in on a Sunday afternoon was unbelievably long.  It took over an hour to check in and that was ridiculous.
plus^The location at the beginning of the Strip is convenient to walk it. The non-themed hotel is refreshing compared with the other options, at least it does not offense good taste.
minus^Distances in the hotel were huge... We walked more to go from our room to the pool and to the parking than in the Grand Canyon the day before. The pool wasn't that good, maybe it was the only thing in the hotel that was small. The margarita that I ordered at the bar totally sucked.
plus^Great room, well serviced, plenty of varied priced meals from al acarte to quick lower priced snacks and meals.... This hotel suits all budgets .... Staff, service,and facilities  all very good!
minus^Liked everything !
minus^Luxurious room with great beds and big and pretty bathroom. Checkout computers near checkout desk, saves time standing in line. Very friendly staff.
plus^Excellent pool complex and some good restaurants. Great rooms, well finished, good location on strip
minus^Very large hotel so very long walk from lifts to rooms. Most restaurants closed by 10-10:30pm during week days. Very slow (45minute) checkout and automatic check out didn't work.
plus^Good atmosphere, good quality rooms in general. Lot's of fun to be had in the hotel and around.
minus^Shower broken and was not fixed during our stay even though we requested it. Very busy weekend stay so very very noisy all night, but this is to be expected I suppose. The price was around three times the normal price due to Labour day weekend, this was a nasty shock. I'm sure its better at other times.
plus^Location is great! Room was very nice and bed was super comfortable. Lots of options for eating, clubs, entertainment within the casino.
minus^No safe...weird for a casino hotel. Drinks were very expensive at all bars and clubs in MGM
plus^The staff was friendly The location is great Great restaurants and options to choose from
minus^The check-in lines were huge The room walls are very thin so you can easily hear the next door neighbors party all night
plus^Excellent value for money.  Pool was great.   Days before  check in (after the free cancellation period),  a lower rate was available via booking.Com. Although booking.com tried to help me in lowering the rate (and announced that a lower rate was not approvingly approvable),  th e hotel approve the lower rate without problems.
minus^The mini bar policy is awful.  There is a small sticker on the mini bar fridge saying that no personal items should be stored in the minibar.  Having not seen this sticker,  I've stored personal items in the fridge and I have been notified that a 50 USD free is applicable.  After verification with the front desk,  a 288 dollar amount was charged due to the fact that I've stored personal items.  It took a few hours to get this charge cancelled!!
plus^The rooms are amazing here, we did a west coast tour of California and were surprised at the value for money. Rooms are spacious and we had a great view.
minus^Nothing!
plus^The Room was clean and quite. The balance quality price is good and the position is quite good - Mgm is located in the strip -. 
minus^It s not the most sofisticated hotel - Btw nothing in Vegas is sofisticated :) - and there's nothing special to see (it s not a tematic hotel so to say). Swimming pool is a mess and it s impossible yo swim. Moreover there's laud music all the time even at 9am. But if you like popular disco music all day long go ahead! Restaurant are decent but good food is very expesive. Hakkasan is definitely overestimated. You can find something cheaper at the same quality. 
minus^The room was recently renovated. Casino and pool area were very fun! The MGM has everything you want to experience in Vegas in one place. I had a great time and will definitely be coming back!
minus^I booked a room for weekend $700. You gave a very unlgy room, far away from the facilites, wit a very small windown to an interior ugly patio (not city vieuw as I booked). I tried to changed and Alex Chacez, manager, he did not do anything. Never more will stay in this hotel
plus^Hotel is amazing. We had a jacuzzi bath. Room was massive. Bed was massive. View of the mountains and hooters.
minus^Mini bar too expensive. Could have done with bubble bath for the jacuzzi bath.
plus^Comfortable bed, large room, great location. We spent weekend, hotel and casino was very crowded. I suggest participation to the shows, it was very nice. There are a lot to do in the hotel and nearby the hotel. They have easy check out machines
minus^It is hard to find place in the park area especialy in the weekend
plus^Room was great. Staff was excellent.  Maids were very friendly and greeted you numerous times as you walked the long hallway. Access to Monorail was helpful
minus^No View Long Walk from elevators
plus^We werent so interested in the casino, but the room was perfect for us. Clean and comfy. Also lots of restaurants and bars in the hotel and the location on the strip is good.
minus^The hotel is so big and feels a little bit like a factory. But i guess all hotels in vegas are the same from that point
plus^the only ting I liked about this place was that the room was very roomy, even tho it was at the end of a long hallway.
minus^this place was deffinatly not for me. very expensive at the resturants, and I couldn't believe the room service prices. most hotels I've stayed at in vegas the handicapped rooms were at the beginning of the hall or very close to the elevator.
plus^Worthwhile just for the pool facilities. Our room and the pool area was sheltered from outside/street music and noise.
minus^Check your credit card bill - I have a random charge that I am yet to hear back on from the hotel.
plus^Lots of things to do, nice pool area. Great with wet republic.
minus^Small room for what you pay, better value and bigger rooms at other hotels. The hotel is really big, got lost a few times trying to find the way to the strip. More signs would be better to find your way out. At the end of the strip.
plus^The location is good.
minus^The room was dirty, stains on carpet, blinds, bed and sink. Staff very unhelpful and manager did not respond when we requested a room change.
plus^When called house keeping, they were prompt and quick. Also had issues with radio and tech guy came and was very nice.
minus^Just a little smaller than expected but made due with it.
plus^The hotel and facilities were great no problem with that side
minus^I was charged a different rate by the hotel compared to the price quoted by booking. Com after a number of phone calls and emails which keep coming back because I continually get given the wrong email address this still remains unresolved
plus^Check in was fast but it was on a Wednesday spa esthetician was great and friendly bartender friendly strong drinks beds comfortable
minus^Prices at spa ridiculous food mediocre housekeeping took forever tv and Internet not working definitely not worth price cheaper hotels on strip way better quality and service
plus^+ location + access to show and performances + restaurants + casino + buffet breakfast
minus^- scent they use in hallways is too strong - too much crowd - somewhat unresponsive personnel due to the crowd
plus^The location
minus^Charge resort fees internet did work throughout the trip and I was overcharged and did not receive a bill stating charges. Calling billing to get it taken care of and on hold over an hour.
plus^Good location with monorail to take you up the strip. Multiple pools with lots of sun loungers and bars. All the staff very helpful especially the concierges. Our hairdryer didn't work in the room, was replaced in under 10 minutes. Excellent hotel.
minus^Restaurants during the week not open after 10pm.  Other hotels had late opening restaurants. Hotel shop very over priced. Shop just outside the west of the hotel sold water for a fraction of the hotel prices.
plus^After complaining about the state of our first room, we were transfered to a much bigger brighter room in the grand tower. It was amazing!!
minus^Our first room was like a prison. No nature light. Tiny window overlooking another room. Horrible smoking smell.
plus^The room (standard king) was spacious, clean and comfortable.  The rooms are very well sound proofed and air conditioned so we had great nights sleep.  Great location on the strip.
minus^The staff at reception could have been more friendly!
plus^We stayed in the west wing and the corridors are a bit 'basement' like. The room was nice, but small. I would recommend staying in the main hotel and not the west wing. Its the same price basically and you get a large room and mini bar etc. Apart from that there are Lots of lovely restaurants and its in a great location.
minus^The casino is very dark.
plus^Location Room design and comfort Hotel entertainment and facilities
minus^Most of the staff who work at Wet Republic were extremely rude.  I would not recommend the pool parties at this hotel solely on the basis of the rude staff.
minus^They tried covering up the smoke in the lobby with some sweet smelling air freshener and smell in the room gave me a headache and a nauseated stomach making it difficult to sleep. Not sure if MGM wanted this odor in the room because it seemed to get worse after the fan was turned on but it smelled of a lot of real cheap cologne.
plus^Staff and room cleanliness was EXCELLENT! Buffet meals hot and extremely reasonable prices except for the weekend rates. Loved the access to the monorail.
minus^Rooms on the 1st floor North Tower had horrible view. Could possibly offset that with advance notice of the room view and maybe one free beverage from refrig per day as an incentive.
plus^Great hotel with everything you could ever imagine, no one should need anymore than they have to offer, fantastic location, a little walk down the strip but plenty of bars and restaurants on way with everything to choose from, vegas is mental but what a brilliant place everyone has to experience it at some point
minus^No kettle in room but this wouldn't stop me going back
plus^everything, pools, wetrepublic, night club, bars..etc.
minus^no mini bar in West wing rooms, noisy at night, no slippers.rooms are a bit small and no priority for hotel guest in anything.
plus^Layout, clean and smells good. And monorail was easy to get to.
minus^a lot of the shops were closed due to season change (i think) and others didn't open till 10 or 4. But that's the hotels falt.
plus^The pool area is lovely and there is lots to do in the hotel. The monorail is based in the hotel so is great for helping you get up and down the strip!
minus^The long wait at check in was annoying especially after a long day travelling. Staff at check in not very friendly. No info given about the hotel at check in just told where our room was, it would have been useful considering the side of the hotel. The blind didn't work in our room we reported it on the first night and was never fixed so never got to see our view! No tea and coffee making facilities in our suite which was disappointing, nothing is complimentary not even a welcome bottle of water. We were on a road trip so had stayed in a lot of hotels and motels and received better customer service.
plus^Room was very nice good view.
minus^All the walking. We self parked in garage and it was so far to walk. You might warn elderly people at check-in to get Valet parking.
plus^Good location
minus^Our non smoking room spelled so horrible that we had to have someone come up and do something about it.  All that was done was a quick spray.  It smelled disgusting like stale smoke!
plus^Excellent circus de soleil KÅ held at the casino. Excellent swimming pool. Excellent japonesse Sushi Bar. And excellent discotheque Hakassan.
minus^Too much noise in the room coming from the corridor (only a couple of times in 6 days). That is, the doors aren't that well noise isolated...
plus^Staff were friendly and very helpful.
minus^Noise in the room. The air conditioning was really loud and the toilet made a loud noise when flushed. The key card on the door also kept making noise every hour or so as if someone was coming into the room.
plus^Myself and GF first time in Vegas and stayed at the MGM and thank god I did, lovely hotel, staff were great the casino was huge and great and the overall feeling of the hotel top notch,
minus^Smell of the oxygen they pumped into the Casino and the Grand Buffet was over priced for sub standard buffet.
plus^Good housekeeping & very clean :) can be very sunny but if you close the curtains it seems like it's night time and you can keep sleeping :)
minus^There's no microwave or fridge for you to use ; nowhere in the hotel :(
plus^MGM has many facilities and you can keep yourself busy all day. The pool is great.
minus^The noise from the hallway echoes trough to your room, bring earplugs if you sleep light. If you check in during the day it can take a while. Come late.
plus^Had a deluxe king room, overlooking the airport. Room was spacious w/good view. Bathroom was OK, although nothing fancy.
minus^Room was rather noisy and the bed too soft. Found myself rolling towards the middle and my wife had neck/back cramps.
plus^- Value for money - Large casino and plenty of shows in-house - Nice modern bathrooms - Located on the strip
minus^- WiFi didn't work in the room - Poor response from staff - On far side of strip, so quite a long walk to Bellagio / Flamingo
plus^The Location is great and the staff is really helpful and nice. The hotel is really beautiful.
minus^The smell was really bad, people can smoke inside and I didn't liked it.  The room was dirty, I find panties in the closet and the room was full of dust.
plus^Price, quality of bedrooms
minus^Swimming pool was dirty. The rooms were stuffed with chocolate and biscuit which would make it difficult for families with children . Just imagine if the child has diabetes
plus^One of the cheapest hotels on the strip, reasonable pool area.
minus^Long check-in lines and shopping centre / airport terminal atmosphere, very long ways, need to cross shopping area to get to the pool.
plus^Room was nice and very cheap for the night we stayed
minus^Was woken up at 8am by staff attempting to clean the room. Given check out wasn't until 11 this was a bit of a surprise. It would pay to put the do not disturb sign on the door at all times with are in the room!
plus^I like the coolness of the room, the view, comfortable bed and the therapeutic freshness of the buildings it smells so great and I love it.
minus^Nothing I didnt like,
plus^Very well appointed, I stayed in the stay well suites. Very nice and quiet. Hotel/casino is gorgeous, several pools for any mood.
minus^Far down on the strip to what we wanted to see. MGM is very pricey, but inline with Caesars, Venetian and other big hotels/casinos.
plus^A bit expensive and the room was pretty standard to others
minus^Price for the stay not much amenities no comps for the club or day club even though we stayed at the hotel
plus^Nice hotel. Very crowded on Saturday night.
minus^Would help if instructions were given for the new shades in the rooms. Did not find blackout curtain until the last night we were there.
plus^The hotels location and it was cheap
minus^The hotel was too big, it felt very Impersonal, the fact that you could smoke in the hotel made it smell, some of the staff had a very  indifferent attitude ( bag drop for example, because I did not offer a tip right away she took forever to deal with my request) It took 1.5 hours of queing before we could check in!!
plus^Front Desk, very helpful when check in and the way the hotel dealt with our request.  Excellent facilities and will stay there again if happen to go back to Vegas or will definitely recommend to friends.
minus^Noisy air conditioning & traffic noise as I am a light sleeper. Smoking allowed in the casino although we were only passing through daily.  Corner Cakes, staff should be more friendly!
minus^Long check-in queue, reserved room was unavailable and were upgraded to another wing (worse than the one reserved), tottaly impersonal approach.
plus^Great suite, amazing pools, very friendly staff, good restaurants, so much fun! Will be our first choice when visiting Las Vegas again!
minus^Mini bar full stocked so there was no room in the fridge for anything we wanted to keep cold and there was a sign saying we could be charged a $50 restocking fee if used as own personal fridge. Make sure you put up Do Not Disturb sign if you want to take things out to make room for your own use and replace in exact spot after because there is a staff member that goes in daily to check and restock the bar.
plus^Everything about this hotel is fantastic.
minus^If I had to pick fault with this hotel the only thing I could think of is the check in queue. However given the size of the hotel this couldn't be helped and the queue did move quickly.
plus^Staff and amenities all A plus
minus^Checked in late at night after long travel only to wait in line for almost an hour to check in .Check in Staff way undermanned.
plus^Excellent places to eat for all budgets Great bars and clubs, Top djs and Best pool party in Vegas Smells amazing!
minus^Maids knocked too early Pool area could be better
plus^The pools, the restaurants and the comfortable room. The express check out touch screens were also a great feature to avoid the queues.
minus^The noise of the air-conditioning plant below our rooms (we were on the 10th floor, room 126 and although it didn't mess up our sleep too much, it was pretty loud at night)
plus^Helpfull staff dealt with our special request as our rooms need  to be close to eachother as our family members came together for our niece wedding . Serves good coffee at  Corner Cake .
minus^Allow smoking in door property/casino area . An attitude of a staff in the Corner cake .
plus^Cost was a great deal!  Location in close to everything Amenities Close to attractions Monorail access to travel the strip  Our room was on the 28th floor so the view was amazing! They gave us complimentary champaign on ice and wine glasses because we were newlyweds!  Also gave us a $50 food and beverage credit!
minus^That I could only stay 4 nights!  Everything else was perfect!
plus^MGM is a great place to stay in Vegas
minus^Stayed there 5 times and this was the first time I've had 'noisy neighbours' so disturbed sleep every night.
plus^Clean and modern room, that we were able to check into1 hour early with no problems. Friendly helpful staff, amazing pool and casino and selection of bars and restaurants. Free parking that was very easy.
minus^If we were being picky, no fridge in the room, but we loved this hotel.
plus^Lazy river . Checking in was fast .staff very friendly . Very clean
minus^Have to pay to get in wet republic or night club in hotel even though your staying at hotel. No perks like 1 free buffet during your stay or 50. Free play money . Only thing didn't like about it.
plus^The room was very spacious, comfortable and clean. Check in was fast and easy. Location was great as well. All in all a great place to stay. 
minus^Noise from the hall way. Probably not all MGM's fault there were some really noisy guests who liked to let everyone know they were still awake at 7am. No real complaints though. 
plus^I have been in mgm Grand from Sunday evening to Thursday afternoon in July 2014 with my wife and my daughter. The hotel is very big and you can get lost inside! The rooms are wonderful, bathroom excellent! The pools are very very good as well. There is a big choice of restaurant, and a very good buffet at reasonable price. Free parking is available with direct connection to hotel. WiFi is free and it works very well despite the big quantity of guests. 
minus^The air conditioning in the common spaces was really set at low temperature for Europeans.... But it is standard for Americans! It is just a warning for Europeans! 
plus^fantastic location on strip great atmosphere in lobby good choice of facilities
minus^problem with booking- room not there on arrival despite being paid in full on booking had to pay twice plus a security deposit, not sure if this is a scam? Yet to be resolved or refunded
plus^Convence and excellent dining options. Also, the bellmen were excellent. 
minus^1. Our room was not cleaned for the entire day. We left our room early    in the morning and returned about 2pm and noted the room had not been    cleaned. I spoke with maide and she said the next shift would take    care of the room. My wife and I returned at 11:30 pm after dinner at    Craft's and a show. The ro was still not cleaned. I called and    reported my dissatisfaction. 2. I called for my room bill the morning we checked out and was told a different balance than what is reflected on the amount charged to my credit card. The difference is $200.00. 
plus^large beds and rooms. Very clean bathroom with nice equipment.
minus^The window view. We were in the ground floor with a view on the bins:(. The hotel in itself is less impressive than the others but is cheaper.
plus^I would like to use the cigar girl Brittany #1 to describe my stay.  She was kind, respectful, and always there when you needed her.  This is how I felt during my stay. Never any doubt that I was going to get the ultimate service in the most professional manner. Everyone was down to earth. Thanks Brittany for leading. You will hopefully be rewarded for making the MGM customers smile even when they lose all their money at the black jack table.
minus^Someone knocked on my door to ask how my stay was going. I had the do not disturb sign up for a reason. My sleep was totally ruined and interrupted.  Intentions were good. But why ignore the sign just to get an interview done. Bad decision by that employee.
plus^The dynamic atmosphere this hotel has, many yound people and a good vibe. allot of activities which the guests can particpate in - comedy club, illusionist, CSI lab, TV city and more. amazing parties especially on weekends and great pool.
minus^Pretty small food court. long lines for parties.
plus^We staying in a king room on a higher floor. Room was awesome, great view, big and clean. Hotel is in a great location. We stayed at three different hotels in vegas during our stay including circus circus and mirage. MGM was the best of the three.
minus^Nothing!
plus^Fantastic time in Vegas. MGM grand was a lovely hotel.
minus^I had one unsightly event when in the MGM. When in the elevator one morning with my kids, there was a condom wrapper open on the floor of the elevator. This is unfortunate as other than that we had a great time.
plus^The beds
minus^The location, the over expensive food, the enormous walks, the concierge who told me the Cirque show tickets were 120 each while I got a MGM (!!!!!) coupon outside telling the second ticket was only 30. Walking all the way back to find not only the concierge closed at 8 PM (????) but also the ticket counter....
plus^No complaints regarding the hotel room and were very clean. Overall, I give this hotel 9/10.
minus^The customer service could use some improvements. I was given the wrong room and the person helping me was not interested in making things right. I had to call booking.com in order for them to change my room.
plus^Lovely modern  hotel, with everything you need. But....
minus^Very Busy like Grand central station in rush hour. Long Queues to check in and check out. Room mini bars are all weighted and any movement at all charges you for the item even if you have not consumed any thing. Don't store any thing in them either or you will be charged. They don't tell you this when you first check in . Only when you look in the fridge you see the sign on top of the coke bottle. Also smoking is allowed in the casino which you have to through to get any where, which makes your hair and clothes smell.
minus^The stay was nice but the check-in clerk offered me a free upgrade to a $1000 room because they were sold out. After clarifying that it was free, the next day they tried to charge me $1000 for the room and I had to fight to get it right. Then after they agreed to charge me my initial fee they went ahead and charged my card $1000 and I had to call back and fight again. I felt my privacy was violated and I felt I was tricked. I always stay at MGM grand but now I'm not sure if can trust them
plus^Large pool, great parties although the door policy kind of sucked.
minus^I discovered an object on the floor and when I picked it up was horrified to discover it was a large flake of someone's foot skin. I called reception explaining the horrific situation but was never offered an upgrade. I've stayed in many 5* hotels and the normal response would be immediate upgrade.  Shocked.
plus^It's a good price. The pools are nice the rooms are comfortable.
minus^Far too busy. Far too big.  You feel like you're in a massive busy airport. Has no class, lacking identity. MGM has clearly gone for the young party market which is fine unless you want a nicer vegas experience.
plus^That Cory at the front desk rectified the double booking by giving us a big room on 17th floor.
minus^When we checked in, we were given a room that had guests already in the room. Luckily they weren't there at the time!! We were surprised and disappointed that guests were allowed to smoke by the pool.They could have had a smoking section instead.
plus^The hotel was very clean. The staff were all friendly and helpful.
minus^I paid $56 per night as a resort fee. This was supposedly for amazing wifi but the wifi kept disconnecting. You also couldn't use it too near the window.
minus^Not much to add to reviews here except great location, super busy so there's a great buzz about the place. Didn't do much else except frequent the Fat Tuesdays store downstairs (go visit it before a night on the town if you don't know what it is!!!).
plus^Very comfortable and quiet room.
minus^Wish there was a coffee maker in the room and a fridge that you can use to cool food and drinks. Staff did not communicate clearly that you would be charged if you simply touched (didn't drink) the things in the stock bar.
plus^Loves our room giant tons of space very comfortable as clean very quiet
minus^The parking sucked felt like we had to walk two miles from the parking garage and we even used valet parking
plus^Modern rooms Good Wi-Fi Comfortable beds
minus^Rooms very small No fridge/mini bar Had to ask for housekeeping to service the room - was only done once in 3 days
plus^Nice Rooms Staff were good
minus^3 Hours to check in due to technical problems however they did compensate . We have been charged twice we have lodged a complaint however they haven't replied. It has been two weeks.
plus^I lioved the lazy river pool.  Nice room, friendly staff, Amenity resturant was a good value.
minus^Walking through smoke filled casino to get almost everywhere. The layout was long, took forever to geet from room to pool.
minus^Very nice comfy rooms for our 3 night stay with our two teenage sons. Massive Hotel but not at all noisy at night. Good location withal the main Hotels within walking distance.
plus^The room was beautiful and modern with very comfortable beds and pillows. It was quite clean and the casino did not smell of cigarette smoke like many others in the area. The pool area was very nice, and the location is obviously great.
minus^There was a hair in the shower which always grosses me out and I had to wait around 2 hours in the line the check in which was ridiculous.
plus^The rooms were super comfortable and quite.. Day or Night you could adjust the room to suit your mood... There wasn't a lot of noise in corridors and the staff were very friendly
minus^I wish they had some kettle or complimentary Tea/ Coffee, cost me $12 bucks just to get some hot water to prepare milk !
plus^Proximity to the strip was perfect although the intense heat made a short walk feel like a half marathon! The Wet republic pool was a lot of fun but ridiculously over priced at €60 for a bucket of 4 bottles of Budweiser. The fast food food-court saved us a fortune as the restaurants in the complex were all totally out of our price range. The suite was really big and really comfortable. You can hook your iPod up to the TV and play music which is great. The bathroom is massive which I really appreciated! The bed is large and very comfy. I think it had a memory foam mattress which is so comfortable.
minus^The price of food & drink is very overpriced but it's the same everywhere in Vegas I guess! **Tip - buy a large coke in the McDonalds and tip some of it out and fill it up with vodka throughout the day. You can bring your drink anywhere in Vegas so it's a real money saver! A couple of the staff were a little rude but some of them were really nice. The ques at reception are the largest I have ever seen in my life!!! It can be hard at times to get a 'free' drink on the casino floor even if you have been playing for quite some time and pumping a lot of money into machines. Some area's of the casino don't seem to be covered by the drinks ladies at all.
plus^All venues were super. Hakkasan, wet republic, justin timberlake concert. Very conveniently located in the hotel.
minus^Sink area in room is so small. A bigger counter would be nice.
minus^-The rooms were fab and the beds very  comfortable -The staff were very helpful -The variety of places to eat was great - All in all we had a great stay, we will definitely be back
plus^Value for money is a draw card at this casino. The rates are very reasonable compared to other hotels. The casino seems to draw a large young crowd perhaps due to it's accessible rates and close proximity to the night life. They have some great restaurants which satisfy everyone's price point from the very expensive down to budget. Apart from walking they have a monorail which would benefit the less inclined to walk the strip. As a person who had business I would consider stayed here again.
minus^Nothing overtly negative.
plus^The price and location made it a simple choice to stay at the hotel. The room was a really good size for two people, with a good view, albeit not over the strip. The casino was amazing, whilst there was plenty of choice of food in the restaurants, although some of it was outside our price range. There were plenty of different pools to choose from, with the lazy river being the best for a party atmosphere. The whole hotel really felt buzzing during our short stay.
minus^The computers at check-in were down, which meant a really long wait to get to our room, as they were having to write everything down by hand. Whilst they did bring drinks and someone came to apologise, this only happened after a very long time, as should have been much sooner. We did get some money back and it wasn't the end of the world, but it wasn't the best start to our stay there. However, I would still stay again as I got the impression this was a one-off incident. Better communication with the people waiting would have made a big difference!
minus^I had to change rooms three times. The drawer in the first room fell off and almost hit my bare feet. Then the noise from nearby construction was annoying. The second room was a smoking room and I am allergic to cigarette smoke. The third room was much more pleasant but dark and small and did not meet my expectations. I travel frequently for business and would not stay at the MGM Grand again.
plus^Staff will help you in anyway possible, they are very polite and professional. The rooms are spacious and well-equipped! The hotel is in a good location, very close to the New York New York casino, EXcalibur, Luxar and Mandalay Bay. A little closer to the Bellagio or Ceasers in the centre of the strip would be perfect out you will have to pay much more.
minus^The size if the casino can make it difficult to get around, but this is unavoidable in Vegas. Otherwise the positives far outweigh the negatives.
plus^I liked how clean the rooms were and how the air didn't smell like smoke. But compared to other hotels this was definitely a must stay!
minus^Our bedsheets smelled a little like sweat. but we were having a great time and didn't have time to ask for a sheet changes.
plus^Not much.
minus^Checking in at 5:00 on a Thursday, the main entrance was a safety hazard. Almost got run over by a Taxi. At check in they could not accommodate two rooms side by side on a non smoking floor.  Called several times in the days leading up to our check in to make the request and it was noted on our reservation but when we checked in, our choices were two non smoking rooms on different floors or two rooms across the hall from each other where the smell of smoke was so bad it made you gag. It was our Son's 21st B-Day which we made clear several times and we wanted to be close to our son. We ended up canceling the reservation on the spot.
plus^Breakfast café was really nice
minus^When we book a suite we expect coffee making facilities in the room.  The suite itself was very basic and the bathroom was rather tired
plus^Great pool and as we were up early is was quite quiet Room was perfect and not noisy Lots of things to do inside
minus^Choice of food for a 1 year old is not great so would bring my own next time (Ella)
plus^At check in they could not register guests, so we waited 4 hours. To compensate, they gave us $100 voucher and waived the resort fees. They then tried to double charge our card. The entire staff except the cleaning crew, were rude, unfriendly and unprofessional. We had an awful next door guest, they were loud and partying. Next time we're staying at Paris.
minus^Staff was awful. They tried to charge our card several times with wrong amounts. Next door guest was noisy. Internet was terrible.
plus^Free parking,  The fast valet service. Easy entry to hotel and access to freeway. have all amenities.  Wide selection of bars and restaurants Updated look.  Pillows were good and bed soft.  Temp in room was good.
minus^The $25 fee per day for a fridge. The pool closes at 7pm which is so early.  Nice room but not sure if housekeeping vacuumed because there was a coffee cup lid on floor. Shower was hot and cold. had to keep adjusting the temp. Long line to check in. had shampoo, lotion etc the first day but never restocked.
plus^Location at the Strip, large rooms, nicely decorated. Friendly staff. Rooms quiet oase in the ongoing circus of Vegas.
minus^So big that it takes 20 minutes to get anywhere from your room.
plus^The suite was massive Bed was comfortable Spa tub was very relaxing
minus^The view of the roof next door Noisy neighbors Room service was quite expensive Navigating the ground floor was confusing The map we were given upon check-in included a listing for Wichcraft, which may no longer be in the hotel? We never found it.
plus^The room and the Devore of the room.
minus^It took almost 40 minutes to check in. I had a show that I had to get ready for and still needed to shower. I felt extreemly rushed. While on line I noticed that it took on average 4 minutes to check in, and much longer if you had a larger party. Then the receptionist took another 2 minutes on another computer (2 out of 5 times). This was extreemly frustrating, and the lines were worse than the TSA.
plus^An excellent stay in a wonderful hotel. Stayed in a Tower Suite which was simply the best. Spotlessly clean on arrival and cleaned daily to a high standard. We ordered breakfast in our room twice, very quick and efficient. The pool area was clean and lots of choice of where to sit, plenty of loungers. Pool staff very welcoming.Casino was great fun. Frozen Margaritas by the pool the best!Food outlets great, difficult to chose which one! Can't wait to return!
minus^Nothing
plus^Pleasant staff
minus^Long lines at check in and out.  Was compd buffet due to the long lines but I never received it.  Hotel is so large it was a quarter mile walk from room to hotel.  Maybe more.
plus^staff were great  hotel was massive with loads to do enjoyed the boxing and nightclub swimming pool areas food and bars were excellent
minus^only negative was the size of the room i stayed in a standard room which was ok for staying a night or two but i was there much longer so i will get a much bigger room next time.
plus^room was well-appointed
minus^long lines for registration, (more than an hour in line) room concessions were massively expensive ($8 for a medium-sized can of Pringle's chips) all prices in the resort were hugely inflated
plus^we liked the vibe  and being sooo central ,
minus^although the rooms were fantastic, it lacked a kettle and coffee/tea machines which we think would be good. also the maintenance staff are a bit slack
plus^The hotel facilities was generally nice.  Won $160 at the slot machines. Gambling floor was fun with 21 and 3 Card Poker, with lots of guests enjoying their stay. Very few $5 minimum tables, so for economical guests, try New York, NY Casino, Planet Hollywood, or other casinos on the strip. Check-out procedures were modern and efficient.
minus^Waiting to check-in for over 45 minutes, at approximately 8:00 pm. Over 60 people were in line, with approximately 4 to 6 front desk clerks.  Hire more Front Desk Clerks !!  After checking in, I visited the lobby again at 11:00 pm, and the check-in line was still a long frustrating wait for guests. What kind of customer service message does this send to guests? No refrigerator to store your own drinks; but they have a computerized refrigerator that charges you if you remove a Coke, Heinekin, or any other beverage ...
plus^Location is perfect. Right in the center of where it all happens! Food at wolfgang Puck is great And prices are fair. Really somthing To try!
minus^Rooms are to small for the price you pay. Other hotels like bellagio, luxor, ect have a better price To quality ratio. Pool is to small for the amount of people in the hotel. Finally, they cheat with fitness, they have a cardio room. But its only cardio!! If you want the full room you pay 10usd extra... Really sad if you pay 277 USD per day And 29 resort fee.
plus^The pool, the staff, the casino, the restaurants and Hakkasan.
minus^The walls in the guest room was so thin I felt like when our loud neighbors came home they were in the room with me!!
plus^Invisalign Paul at the taxi line was very friendly and answered all of our important and ridiculous questions. :-)
minus^The man at check in was completely dull and skipped half the required statements, such as verifying room rate, room type and check out date.
plus^The hotel is amazing, huge and has everything so that you don't have to go anywhere.  Service and parking work very well considering it's size, and rooms are spacious and well appointed.  However, lack of cleanliness is a fact for which I would not come back to the hotel.
minus^We had two rooms and the bathtubs didn't drain.  When I tried uncolgging one of them it was gross.  When reported to the hotel they said maintenance would come, but that never happened.  The real problem was cleanliness, as the bathroom walls were also a bit disgusting and one of the chairs was badly stained.
plus^Everything was very nice.
minus^Checked in on a Sunday evening, had to stand in line for 1/2 hour.  Also, watch out for the $25 per night resort charge.  Fortunately, we were able to have that charge removed.
plus^The location of the hotel is great - there is a bridge connecting to New York New York across the street and you can easily access bars along the strip there. There are always taxis available, even if you do have to queue a little sometimes (depending what time of day it is). There is a good atmosphere inside at all times (unlike, say, Caesars Palace which was a huge disappointment) and a good selection of facilities. There is also an area in the lobby that is easy to use and allows you to check in online and print off your boarding pass for your departing flight, free of charge.
minus^The walls of the hotel room are quite thin - I was woken up a couple of times by other guests talking loudly in the corridor outside my room.
plus^Hotel was comfortable and accomodating. Facilities were excellent and plenty of things to do and see. Never bored and all entertainment was easy to locate and participate in. Room service was prompt and courteous. They helped with additional toiletries and attempted to cater all our requests. Has a great time for an excellent price.
minus^It was the evening and we had just got married. I had heard amazing things about friends who had stayed there after marrying and how they were treated amazingly and helped them to have a good evening with recommendations on what to do that evening, where to eat, offered free dinner and free play chips and champagne. We received no such thing. No assistance of any kind of attention was put on us whatsoever, and despite being willing to pay for an upgrade in room and our own meal we encounter Noone at all in the main casino. The people bringing drinks to the slot machines not once came over to offer a drink despite us spending considerable cash in the casino that night. The only person who approached us that night was a management figure who offered me a players card but when I asked if I could get an upgrade to the room, told us to wait in line at front reception to book it ourselves. We declined to do this after as it was taking away enjoyment of the night. If you are going with friends, the MGM Grand is an excellent hotel but the casino didn't cater for us and i would recommend spending the evening elsewhere, somewhere more intimate especially if for a special occasion such as getting married, Batchelor party etc
plus^-Great hotel -Great value for money -Enjoying Vegas in style and affordably
minus^-Losing all your money in Vegas but you can't blame the MGM for that, only yourself...
plus^Michael Mina pub, Hakkasan only reason why MGM is staying relevant. Other than that it's the same show.
minus^I worked for 5 star hotels for 8 years, so I know what I'm talking about. I could of gotten a suite somewhere else for the same price. Room was way too small and it was a hike from the elevators. The lobby checkout was ridiculous, only had one person checking out during primetime checkout at 11am!!!! I waited 25mins, and there was enlighten FD agents at the check in side for at least 1 other person to come over and help. Or at least a manager. I have stayed at many properties in Vegas, I have never had the worst room and experience. Will be staying at ANY great hotel in City Center for now on, I've should have known better!
plus^Rooms were nicely decorated and a good size.   Didn't really have much to do with any of the staff except for check in.  They seemed pleasant.
minus^I think it was ridiculous to charge $7 for an 8.5 oz bottle of coke as well as a small glass of milk.  I understand you need to make money but you don't have to screw people.  You could have charged $7 for a 12 oz can of coke and even thought it would have been expensive it seems better.  We also waited 55 min. for it the food when we were told it would take 30min.  The food was not good.  The bowls of 3 layer guacamole,sour cream and tomatoes was terrible.   The guacamole was soarer in both bowls. I  Terrible service and rip off.
plus^The room was great and the bed was very comfortable. The hotel had lots to do and the pools were fantastic with no problem getting a sun bed.
minus^However because the hotel was so big it took a long time to get around. It took an hour to check in and about half an hour to check out because there was so many people. Also we had a small stain on our sheets and after ringing down they took 3 hours to come and change them- we were wanting to sleep after a long journey- but they did knock some money off our bill for it. Overall a great stay but I think next time I'd want to stay in a smaller hotel.
plus^Spacious and confortable room Very good gourmet restaurant and various style (French, Chinese, Japanese,..) The shows
minus^- clearing not done 1st day and second they knock at the door at 7.45am - 80mn to check in it is a shame (lack of employees)
plus^Good location on the strip. Secure Valet parking, clean rooms with a safe for valuables that is easy to program and operate
minus^The Casino was full of cigarette smoke,  It seemed worse than other Casinos and you need to walk through the casino gambling area to access the strip.
minus^No use of refrigerator, no coffee machine, no admission to gym, yet we paid a $50 resort fee. We had to use trash cans with ice to keep stuff cool. Not to mention, misleading info on room selection during biking process. I thought I was getting a great deal for a large suit but just got a standard room. Also, the checkin guy was very unwilling to help.
minus^They gave me a room with handicap access I'm not handicapped. When we asked them to change it they said everything else was booked there was nothing they can do.
minus^It ruined the whole experience. The check-in process took 1.5 hours. 5 long lines deep of people. Started in line at 6:30pm got to the agent at 7:50pm. Agent was very good and quick but it was the line that killed it for us. For housekeeping, a piece of paper was on the floor. Something like a straw wrapper and crumbs under the bed which you could see while sitting in the chair.
plus^Loved the lazy river! Didn't even open until 10:00am so we didn't have to wake up at the crack of dawn to get a seat.
minus^A little pricey... 6 breakfast burritos $150.00, $18 for a mixed drink by the pool, etc.
plus^Absolutely nothing
minus^- crowded , bad organized  - no Any normal food before evening time (only Starbucks and other non-eatable fast food) - queues everywhere (parking, check in, any restaurant and so on)  - in reality - no any room service, no breakfasts
minus^I had a room booked and they down graded me to a lesser room for the same money. All they did was give a $75 gift card to spend on there property. Sorry service.
plus^Excellent room Pool facilities Wide choice of dining options Quick & easy check out
minus^Complexity of the layout and poor signage made it hard to get around and find places Noise of planes from very nearby airport Long queue (45 minutes) to check in & very busy all the time
minus^I stayed at the west wing 1st floor. Very loud and not appropriate for someone thats there for business. A lot of people walking around and late a night taking loud and making a lot of noise that disturb my sleep. I know it's Vegas and I would stay there for leisure but not when I travel for work again.
plus^The 14 the floor of the grand tower have been upgraded to what the MGM call 'stay well rooms'. This means the rooms have an upgraded cleaning procedure, mood lighting, aromer diffuser, dawn simulated alarm and vitamin c shower, among other things.  On the whole a real impressive hotel and every bit a match to the popular wynn and encore.  Loved it.
minus^I liked to walk and explore the strip which is mission. The MGM is near one end so without a cab it's quite a trek to the other part.  I may consider something more central next time between the Mandalay bay and encore. Check in and out que was quite a long 30 min wait.
plus^Good restaurants, theatre show excellent, CSI experience is fun. Direct access to monorail.
minus^We had a non-smoking room but it stank of smoke, when we complained they offered to send someone up with a spray rather than to move us ! Pool actually honestly smelled of beer there were so many drinkers and smokers around and in it at all times. Only about 5 umbrellas round the pool  for hundreds of loungers so no shade in intense sun. the public areas were very crowded compared to other hotels on the strip and it is a bit run down, needs some TLC.
plus^We stayed in one of the newer Stay-Well rooms and it was just a great experience.  Room was clean, staff was friendly, overall environment of the hotel and casino was just very comfortable.  Many places to eat and do things within walking distance as well.
minus^There really isn't anything bad other than the sink not draining well, but once we had our first turn-down service, returning to our room showed that sink all of a sudden is clear and draining very well...assuming they unclogged whatever, thank you regardless.
plus^Great location. Number 1 hotel in Vegas best shows, with pool and the biggest  DJ parties in the world.
minus^Do not use the hotel phone will cost as much as the room.
plus^The third Customer Service Rep I talked after 3 hours
minus^The first floor room the third floor room.smoking rooms The first 2 Guest servies clerks I spoke with  La Keisha and Mr Odell
plus^Got a great room my first night there. Amazing views and suite.
minus^Couldn't find a suite on my second night and had to pay premium prices for a very small room - and this news came after a long long wait in the check-in line.
minus^We walked into the Junior suite and turned on the A/c left for a couple of hours and when we returned the room had a stagnant order coming from the A/c unit we called (was on hold for a very long time) the front desk. They sent house cleaning and they sprayed a deodorizer.  The stench remained. We call the front desk again and this time no one picked up the phone.  I walked down to the main floor I saw an employee with a radio asked him to contact the hotel manager . I was told to go to security since they are the only ones that can call a hotel manager.  I walk to the security desk and was told he cannot call a hotel manager.  I told him really you have a phone and a radio and he directed me to the front desk.  I walked up to the front desk and I requested to speak with a hotel manager.  I was asked my room number and my name and he wanted to know why I needed to speak with the manager.  I refused to tell him why I needed to speak with the manager. He walked to the hotel manager and I could see and hear him tell her that I refused to tell him what my issue was with an attitude.  I finally explained to the manager what the issues were.   I also asked her why wasn't maintenance called up to the room.  She then asked me, do you want me to call them up?  I told her absolutely not since all they did was put lipstick on a pig when they sprayed the deodorizer.  I also told her to take a walk to the room so that she could smell the room she said no I'll take your word for it. Her only option was to move us to another room.  She gave me the room key and I had to insist that she send a bell hop to help us move. The next day we were waiting at the entrance between the store and the booth when we noticed what looked like a caramel texture after we got a better look at it, it was sweet & sour from McDonalds that was on the floor.  I went into the store to report it and nothing was done.  I went to the booth and nothing was done about it.
plus^everyone was really nice 2 us. we enjoyed our stay
minus^The buffet    We ate about 2:00 and there was no Meat on carving board which was in your adverting.  cost  was higher than any place we ate in las vegas
plus^The room is ultra modern with huge king size bed, study table, flat screen TV, lounging chair, separate and telephone in toilet and shower.  The pluffy pillows and mattress are comfortable. Being in the center of everything like shopping and gaming if you are a casino lover is a plus.
minus^The room didn't have a coffee maker which I find a necessity for me especially when I wake up in the morning.  I stayed here for two nights because our house was inhabitable at the moment because of water damage and molds and I had to checked in a hotel comparable to our home.
plus^Beautiful, large, newly renovated rooms in Grand Tower, facing the strip... and great price.  Excellent service.  Will return!  Thurs night price for King Deluxe:  $75.
minus^We booked reservation approx two hours before we arrived.  When we checked in, our reservation was not in MGM's system yet.  Apparently there is a few hours of lag time for Booking.com's reservations to download into MGM's.  Therefore it took approx 30 mins to get our room.  MGM was great in handling it.  Even gave us $50 food credit, and wonderful rooms for the delay!  Employees at front desk were wonderful.
plus^The only thing i liked was the location of the hotel .
minus^I didn't like the service of the staff. i never felt welcomed the five days i stayed . For the amount of money we payed the staff should have at least looked acted like they like their jobs.
plus^Hotel is big, impressive and fun
minus^You'll wait in line for everything. An hour to check in, half an hour for a restaurant, another half hour for a taxi and finally twenty minutes for a coffee from Starbucks at 6am on the morning you're leaving
plus^Great luxury room, large and comfortable. The pool complex is very nice. All the things you can imagine are inside the hotel.. Nice and fast checkout.
minus^Crowded- as a huge, top-of-the-line hotel it is very very crowded. Very Long check-in due to the same reason. In the last couple of days there was some sort of conference held there which we weren't aware of and the place was practically swarming with attendants which was quite annoying, long elevator waits and what-not.  Prices online are boosted by the  tax+resort fee+resort fee tax+...  Everything is expensive..
plus^I liked the updated decor and the cleanliness of the room
minus^For a person to use the elevator to the rooms, for security, you should have t swipe your room key
plus^lovely modern room, very clean. friendly staff
minus^long walk through corridors to room. Smell of smoke through casino (although nowhere near as bad as Treasure island)
plus^The localization : very central to everything ! Te closeness to the Tram's Station ! The rooms are very good !
minus^I'll be to the point : the only thing I didn't like was arriving ( after a 8hours airplane trip ) tired and having to be on this huge line , just to check in ! One hour and a half on this line !
plus^I love everything about the hotel.You really didn't have to leave for anything only to site see.Checking in was great and the staff was very friendly and just great.
minus^Nothing everything was great
minus^From the first moment on after you've parked your car you realise how big this facility is, but don't get scared, everything works like a streak and when you're in your luxurious room, you feel good. Walking around is easy, the strip is just 5 min through the casino and restaurants. A must have experience when you want luxury on a budget.
minus^There was a serious issue with the plumbing which they did not address. It was awful being covered by dirty toilet regurgitation. I had to shower after this happened, and it ruined my night. On top of the trauma I suffered, the front desk merely said they'd send someone up to look at it later. Not even an apology. I won't be staying here again.
plus^luxurious palace. food, gambling, pool parties, night club. none stop fun
minus^there were some staff at the bell desk who were very rude when asked basic questions and to carry out simple tasks
plus^The Second Room web get was Ok. The hotel is very confortable for a affordable price
minus^on our second stay 07/06 the first night we get a room in the westwing section. the room was very small the deco was OK but no double bed a very little window we had to complain to get a new room even the reservation was made the same for the nights 06/22/23
plus^Everything? The location, the price, the staff, the things to do. It was so awesome.
minus^The line was a little long to check in but that's to be expected.
plus^Spacious rooms
minus^Waited for 30 minutes to check in. 30 minutes. The queue wasn't even long (8-9 people tops at a time), it was just bad organization. Casino is okay but tight to walk around when crowded.
plus^On Las Vegas Strip. Huge hotel so allow extra time to get around. 20 mins queue to check in but in a hotel that size it's understandable. Room was on 12th floor so quiet enough, but not quite as nice/modern as the pictures make it look. Plenty of options if you want to eat or drink in the hotel. A monorail which goes to the top of the strip is connected to the hotel.
minus^The only fridge in the room was filled with hotel stock and a note said you'd be charged and if you put your own stuff in there, there would be a $50 restocking fee. Also we made a 10 minute out of state phone call from the room and were billed $28! Are they not making enough money??
plus^Helpful front desk staff. Very nice room. Very good and varied restaurants Very good temperature control Towels large enough to wrap around
minus^Room cleaning was not great. Same pieces of dirt in corner by bed the whole week. Table top not wiped every day. Garbage can in bathroom not emptied every day.
plus^Room was quiet.
minus^Upon arrival, main hall was filled with questionable patrons.  Check in desk attendants were less than friendly at 12.30am checkin.  Foyer was not attractive or clean, looked old and flowers were not fresh.  Pool area was very DISAPPOINTING!  With full sun and 100 degree weather during the summer, there were NO umbrellas nor shade to be had other than the cabanas!  Furthermore, there was not an adult only pool area- children were everywhere!!!!  WE WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO THIS FACILITY!
plus^The bed was very comfortable and the monorail station is attached to the hotel.
minus^The MGM is at the extreme end of the strip- away from most of the action and makes for a long walk to the other casinos.  This is important because the staff and facilities at the MGM are so sub-par you will want to experience the luxury of the other casinos. I'm not a high roller but when I travel, I come prepared to tip well ($20 each) for valet and bellmen.  When I arrived, there was no valet to park the car and no bellman to take our bags to the room.  The woman working at the check in desk (who I was also prepared to tip) seemed disinterested and wasn't friendly.  She mentioned a perk of our room was that it was near the West Wing Bar. We had a guest room in the West Wing.  BEWARE THE WEST WING.  It's shabby and located on the opposite side of the casino.  We had to drag our bags through the main floor, past the buffet, past the night club, past the bar, past another restaurant to a creepy hall.  Down the creepy hall (dank and smelled funny), we passed a Starbucks (open half of the time we were there) and the West Wing Bar (remember this perk?  It was not open the entire time we were there).  We had to go through another door that was only accessible by using our room keys- a security feature.  This was actually necessary as our far flung room was easily accessible to the street.  For those that haven't been to Vegas, there is a considerable homeless population and they hang out on the strip at night.  Only this security feature didn't work and we were able to open the door without our room key. This means that anyone off the street could have walked in to our secure hotel wing. The actual hotel room was fine- despite the smell in hallway.  The West Wing is filled with budget travelers, families, and tour groups.  This means it's loud and not luxurious.
plus^We checked in early and they were able to accommodate us without issue. There were lots of choices for food. There were several pools. The automatic shade was nice, including a black out one.
minus^The tub clogged up for a bit.
plus^rooms updates and clean, restaurants/services on property offer plenty of choices, free parking and close enough to hotel, location on fringe of strip easy to get to / no traffic
minus^hotel was chosen for pool (for teens), but not family friendly at all!!! ...the river was packed with drinking adults, behaving immaturely. There was a major DJ event going on during our stay and maybe this is the reason, but would be cautious trying it another time incase this is the norm at MGM
minus^I worked for the WFG Company I arrived on Tuesday June 24th. For our 30,000 people conference and since the first day of my stay at the MGM Hotel the AC was not working properly. That first night I contact the main office, a tech came next day but nothing was repaired because it was warm, horrible and muggy. I called them again and the tech never came. Next day I called them back and the tech came and said the AC was broken that they have to move me to another room that never happened. I paid $600 for a 4 star hotel room that was a nightmare to stay in, Vegas temperature is very high, when you go to your hotel room you want to be in a comfortable and cold room, after a long day was speck ting more than the 50% off on compensating all the trouble I went thru in that 4 days. And the only compensation I received from the hotel was to remove the hotel fee. And they treatment to customers is that they don't care at all.
plus^Check in person was very helpful and friendly. As our luggage hadn't arrived, they advised us on where to go shopping and also upgraded our room for free. Bed was comfortable and room was spacious.
minus^Our non smoking room smelled of stale smoke. The cabanas at the pool could have been more plush, the seats had stains on them and there was food from previous day on the ground. Having said that, the cabana service was very good and we enjoyed our day by the pool immensely. Bathroom amenities weren't great.
plus^The staff was very courteous and it was gray to get dinner voucher ,but that lasted me about one meal since it was pretty expensive ,the hotel is itself grand hence probably the name MGM grand .
minus^That the room was at the end of the lobby and the closest elevator smelled really bad , the main elevator was okay , also the room was pretty hot despite the ac .The are no bed lamps or electronic ports closer to the bed .
plus^The space in the room.
minus^No personal fridge. If you used the mini-bar fridge there was a $25.00 re-stocking fee. An additional fridge was available at a cost of $25.00 per day.
plus^Free upgrade to an incredibly comfortable room. The swimming pool complex was great if a little overcrowded.
minus^The check in staff didnt mention the $200 security deposit when we checked in. Understandable that they have to take one but should have been made clear to us. Some of the restaurants close surprisingly early considering Vegas' reputation for being 24 hour partying.
plus^hakkasan nightclub, grand pool, didn't get charged resort fees due to broken toilet
minus^Broken toilet! It almost spilt to the floor! Kids entered the hallway through fire escape and camped in front of my room. I got the farthest room possible, so the walk to the room from main lobby was not fun.
plus^The david copperfield show, the room was big and comfortable. Staff were good.
minus^room servicing was quite late (15.00) bins not emptied one day, no loo rolls one day.  There was little shade around the pool when temp. was 110 F. The loud head banging music drove us out after an hour.
minus^The hotel was a short drive from the airport considering prices for taxi, the room was not ready ontime but we were compensated so that helped. Room was nice and clean and we had a ok view of the strip.
plus^Customer service :)
minus^Rooms to small. Not enough counter space in the washroom. Walls too thin you could hear everything. Bathroom door not private enough .
minus^Its not fair to pay for these of the gym once you already pay so much for the room stay. The pool is nothing like the website and the staff on the check in was really rude.
plus^Staff was experienced and ready to help.
minus^Room too small. Horrible view. Very expensive. Over 100 yards down hallway to main elevator. No fridge. Poor lighting. No TV schedule. Internet not working. Room phone static.
plus^Good parking
minus^Long waiting line for check-in.  After electronic check-out did the room key not work anymore without warning. very, very large, you walk very long to the rooms. In the room was a dirty towel hanging, it had been forgotten by the room cleaners
plus^Very comfortable beds. WiFi that comes with the resort fee (3 mbps) is very fast; the upgrade to the faster version is not needed. Pool area. Soccer World Cup games were shown in the lobby so we could watch during check-in/out (for both we had to wait quite long).
minus^The door to our room (standard room, king size in the West Wing) was quite worn. When a neighboring room door closed our door always moved so much that the first few times we thought somebody walked into our room.  Long wait at check-in despite a lot of check-in staff (at least 15-20); MGM is just popular. Also wait time at express checkout with the iPad stand; there are only 4 and some guests just don't know how it works despite the very easy menu; so maybe more iPads would be good. No coffee maker in the room. Some TV-channels lost their signal after a few minutes.
plus^Very nice room, nice bed, best entertainment system ever!
minus^The complex is so big, you'll get lost the first time. We had a room on the 6th floor...still no view of the strip...
plus^The location is great, right on the strip with easy access to the monorail. We were there in late June so with the 44C+ each day this was very useful to get around. Our room was spacious, clean and comfortable. The pool facilities were fantastic: lots of different pools to cater for everyone.
minus^The hotel is incredibly large and therefore very difficult to find your way around. Although there was fridge in the room, it was filled with hotel supplies: touch them and you were charged, add your own item to the fridge and there was a $50US restocking fee. Really!!!
plus^The hotel itself was amazing the poolside was great and the overall location
minus^You can hear ppl walkin down the corridors outside your room The cleaners started knocking your door at 6 am which I thought was too early but I do realise they have a lot to do
minus^Long queue at the time of check- in. It took almost 50-60 minutes to check-in. Hotel needs to fix this problem quickly. Also no coffee maker in the room.
plus^The location and facilities were perfect.
minus^They messed up reservations not only my reservation but a couple more guests. They gave the rooms I reserved to other guests then they made me walk to the Signature Rooms and the manager said she would give me better rooms for no added cost. When I got the Signature rooms reception area, there were a couple of guests waiting, with complaints, only to be made to wait by the receptionist again. The manager of the Grand Wing had to talk to me on the phone again to tell me that there are no available rooms at that wing and was told to go back again to the Grand Wing reception and it was already 4AM and I had to drive several hours from LA to LV and Was very tired already.
plus^Pool area, location on the strip, monorail stop, easy to park and lots of taxis
minus^Check in took too long, check in agent fairly rude, advert netting around the windows of our room was horrible, lions were gone, air conditioning too cold in hotel compared to other hotels/bars
plus^Everything was realy great. Next year I want come back of course mgm Grand hotel :) 
minus^For me was to much air condition in the hotel but I come from Europe that's why :) 
plus^Rooms were okay but weren't amazing. Good location.
minus^First night our room was on the ground floor and had a large gap under the door so we could hear everyone returning from their nights out. Staff were pretty poor...I asked a lady on reception about the club in the hotel and she said we had to pay when we didn't. I had to kick up a stink to get us moved to a different room and this was better but again not great with a window facing a building
plus^OK rooms and facilities
minus^This hotel is very large. It took us about 10-15mins to get to the carpark which meant driving anywhere took that bit of extra time. The hotel was OK but nothing great and not worth the extra money. Rooms small and the showers in our room mouldy. Cleaners seemed to avoid tidying rooms. The place was fine just not great value for money.
minus^Had to wait 90 minutes at the check in line. There were more than 250 people in the line. Furthermore, after getting the room and requesting the luggage to be send to my room, I was told to wait for an hour. My husband went to bell station to retrieve luggage himself. The hotel gave him our luggage after more than an hour. I have never been to a hotel where just checking in and getting the luggage took 2 and a half hour. Never going back to MGM again!! Room did not even have a coffee machine.
plus^Great hotel with lot to do around it.
minus^No wifi, room wasn't restocked while we were there (we ran out of toilet paper and other things). The wifi didn't work in our room. Not a bad place by any means but I think I could have enjoyed a better room for the same price somewhere else. But I mean really, who cares about the room? It's Vegas.
plus^Location
minus^Staff were horrible, never attended me or listen to my problems with suite, no hit water or tv, I rather to spend my money at Motel 6 than to go to MGM again
plus^The staff was extremely friendly/helpful. We had issues with our tv so they gave us $60 credit to use for room service!
minus^The parking is horrible. No valet or baggage service. No view.
plus^Great hotel  Absolutely useless staff who clearly had no ideas what they were doing and Could never Answer us
minus^Great hotel  Absolutely useless staff who clearly had no ideas what they were doing and Could never Answer us
plus^great location and convention facilities were fantastic.
minus^Toilet broke and continued to run all night, TV stopped working until following day,Staff on floor gave a very cold and uninviting attitude.
plus^Extremely spacious room, very comfortable bed, clean. Staff very helpful and correct. Nice pool. The food in the Wolfgang Puck restaurant is w-o-w!
minus^Well, it's Vegas so expect high extras...
plus^The facility was very clean, beautifully decorated, and comfortable. Restaurants were FANTASTIC!  Pool area was wonderful...really enjoyed the lazy river.
minus^Room service was too pricey to try.  Water pressure in shower was a little low.
plus^The rooms were a good size and had nice bathrooms. It was quiet once in the rooms which is good. The casino is clean and I would say solid mid range casino - not super fancy but certainly not as 'dodgey' as some of the others. We had fun time at the MGM!
minus^The location was ok but I'd prefer to be a bit further down in the middle of the strip. However, it was easy to get around.
plus^it was clean
minus^when I first checked in the fact that they charge that deposit of 200 when online booking didn't said anything like that so I hope I get refund those 200 dollars my boyfriend paid please thank you!!
plus^Fantastic Hotel,really great place,great price,great atmosphere and lovely rooms
minus^Having to pay resort fees&I imagine its not family friendly but otherwise a FANTASTIC hotel.Definitely recommend it.
plus^We liked the fact you didn't have to go to far to get anything.  The restaurants we visited were good.  Great food great service.
minus^The front counter staff were very rude, when we arrived they told us the room we booked was not available because we arrived to late and they gave it to someone else, we arrived around 8:30pm, we just arrived from Australia on our honeymoon very tired so it was a disappointment, when we complained they just said there's nothing they could do, also they said we may get our room the next day, we stayed there 5 nights but never heard from them about it. When we put in a complaint they gave us $100 off.  Booking.com even rang the hotel on our behave to get us our original room, and the front desk staff were so rude to them, that booking.com even hang up on them.
plus^Good selection of restaurants and shows/events
minus^Room was nice but the temp stayed around 75-77 which was a little warm especially while trying to sleep
minus^The waiting for the check in and check out is really terrible, awful.  The way the people is dressing should not be allowed to be in a Casino, where are the times of jacket and tie? People almost nude in the lobby, really disgusting.
plus^Great location, and very big hotel.  Rooms have been updated and are very nice. Tons of very good restaurant options.
minus^Rooms are not very sound proof, so it can get loud at night.  We lost a lot of money at the casino.
minus^Wonderful, happy, pleasant staff. It was my birthday and the staff made it wonderful. Checking in was organized and quick! Clubs, food and casino were easy to navigate and security when I could not find one of my friends helped which was fantastic and so kind of them! I will definitely be back soon with more guest to share the experience!!
plus^Staff were always very helpful, location was wonderful and facilities excellent.
minus^Check in was diabolical for a hotel of 7500 rooms. I queued for an hour and a quarter. You know it's bad when you can see people ahead of you reading books and eating sandwiches. I do not take the size of the hotel as an excuse, if you are big then you should cope with the number of guests.
plus^Nice hotel 
minus^Way to expensive for the common people im a chef in denver .Had breakfast from room service $71 for two ppl come on man!!!!!!! Breakfast If the rich pay that much to eat I have property in ten buck two!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
plus^Good location and it's a big hotel and casino the rooms were very nice with good house keeping and nice big parking we were upgraded so that was cool
minus^Over priced mini bar and shop at the base and very limited free channels on TV but overall good
plus^The room was large and comfortable. We had a good view of the strip.  The hotel was at the start of the strip, so you never missed much that was going on.
minus^Too busy for me, it filled up with thousands of youngsters queueing for Hakasan nightclub in the evening, and you couldn't get moved or served anywhere. Staff were so busy, they never had time to be friendly with customers. There were no tea making facilities in the room, it felt like the hotel was only interested in your money, not your custom.
plus^Luxury for a bargain, clean and comfortable, nicely renovated (we had a standard room in the West Wing), lururious interior design
minus^The bed wasnt good for me (actually a bed which they tried to compensate with a soft top matress). But that's very personal because everyone else in our group loved the beds. Absolutely no complaints besides this minor issue.
plus^Hakkasan is an amazing club.  Staff was helpful for the most part.
minus^The pools had no music playing other than what you could hear at Wet Republic.  NY Pizzeria in the food court gave me good poisoning.
plus^Leaving this hotel.
minus^Long line up checking in and out! Valet parking was slow! No coffee in the room! Loud parties in the hall! Long wait for elevator! Pool was over crowded! Room had a bad door! Air conditioner kept turning off. The list goes on
plus^Beautiful room, comfortable bed, person who delivered room service had great customer service skills
minus^Hallway noise was very loud, even though I requested a quiet room. Very long wait to check in. No coffee maker in room.
plus^Great room, great location, great casino resort facilities.
minus^There was a long queue for checking in, plenty of check in desks but not enough staff. We found the experience at the various dining options rather disappointing in relation to the prices. The buffet was good however.
plus^Bell Captain luggage system is excellent. Considering the size of this hotel,you get your luggage very fast.
minus^Check in is horrible. Takes at least 20 or more minutes. Highly inefficient for such a big hotel.
plus^Our spa suite was really nice but it didn't make up for the long lines, rude staff, and overall feeling that the hotel is overcrowded
minus^The staff was incredibly rude upon checking in and were listing off statistics as to how busy they were. We got there before our check in time and I wasn't expecting to be able to get our room but I did expect them to notify me when the room was ready. They refused and I had to wait in that incredibly long check in three times... Just to check in my room! After I was told I was checked in, I was then told by another staff member over the phone that I wasn't actually checked in. It was a huge mess and I can definitely say that I will never stay here again. You can find the kind of Vegas hospitality you hear about at other hotels and paying a little extra is worth it to not stay at mgm. I've stayed at two other Vegas hotels on the strip and their service was above and beyond mgm.
plus^Almost everything is perfect.
minus^When I tried to extended my stay for one extra night, the hotel told me it will cost me 750 USD, I logged in to booking.com web site and booked the same room for the same day for 90+ USD... So watch out....
minus^my room was not that clean,and bathroom had spots ,over all was all dusty,,the casinos and other facilities were great,it was my anniversary it was good but not the room ihad to give it a quick clean,,
plus^Location
minus^Hotel room is in really bad shape.  It was the newly built addition too, but the construction is shoddy and major wear and tear are showing already.
plus^Staff was polite and cordial
minus^The air conditioning in my room was struggling to cool the room and it took many hours and two request for engineering to somewhat fix it...Very hard to sleep in a room that is hot
plus^Couple of years ago I stayed there and enjoyed it thats y I choose this hotel again
minus^As soon as we checked in we were disappointed bybthe behaviour of the bell boy amd other staff
plus^One of the biggest hotels located directly on the Strip with a lot of entertainment possibilities and restaurants options.
minus^The hotel is really big but the number of elevators is quite small - sometimes there is a long queue for the elevators. Moreover, our room was located at the end of a hallway which meant almost 5 minutes walk from the elevator (not very pleasant when you forget something in your room).
plus^Lovely hotel w/ nice staff. Spacious room with a  view.
minus^Really weak [shower] water pressure and a dirty shower curtain - the bottom of the shower curtain was not only discoloured, which I understand happens sometimes in homes, but it was caked in filth. Actually dirty. Call me crazy, but I don't see any excuse for this in a reputable hotel.
plus^location
minus^room 7202 the toilet made strange gurgling sounds and emits sewage smells when other guests flush. dont know if this is a health risk but could be messy if a guest was effected be the fumes or if like old faithful the hole thing blows.   ( this does make the room smell bad when you arrive as a new guest)
plus^The MGM has so many things to offer that you can't be disappointed. The staff are helpful and friendly, the rooms are just right, there's lots of great restaurants and bars. Great location on the start of the stripe to start your visits to all the other fabulous hotels, shops, bars and restaurants.  I would highly recommend this hotel, great value for all you get as the hotel speaks for itselfs. Great time there and in Vegas.
minus^Nothing at all 
plus^- elegant furniture and room design - spacious and cozy bathroom - really worthy during weekdays discounted prices
minus^- fridge items extra high prices  - they charge a fee if you use the fridge to store your cans - a really discourteous practice. Shame on you, MGM.
plus^The pool 
minus^The front desk guy at the hotel was not very helpful. Asked him about what to eat food-wise at the mgm and did they have any coupons to anything. He said We don't do that. They put us in a room on the first floor with no view. I asked if I could upgrade at the desk and he said I would have to wait. Could n't tell me how long or arrange the upgrade for later so we took the 1st floor room. Talked to a bellman two hours later and complained and he was able to get us into a room on the 28th floor, no problem. We paid $30 to upgrade which was fine. This should've been arranged from the beginning with a lot less attitude. 
plus^Nice room with modern decor, pool area very nice. Grand buffet has great food at good value for money. Free parking.
minus^Massive queue to check in (40 minutes), casino has loads of $25 minimum tables which are empty then the $10 tables are full!
plus^- Immense hotel, with facilities to everyone's liking -Clean, modern and spacious rooms - On the Strip - Free parking
minus^- Huge queue for check-in, but I think that was mainly due to the fact that it was Memorial Day when we arrived - Hotel was a bit too big and too over the top to my liking, but hey, that's Vegas, right? - Proper food (read: not fast food from the food corner) is relatively expensive, but that compensates for the rather cheap rooms.
plus^The room was nice. I really loved the bed
minus^The room did not have a refrigerator. Also, I was placed in a room right by the outside sign. Consequently, my room was not very dark because the sign was so bright.
plus^The location of this property is excellent and in the heart of all the action on the strip.
minus^I understand that it was a holiday weekend but that does not excuse receiving dirty/soiled towels and bed sheets. I think I would've rather slept on the floor. Not what I expected for the price we paid. Definitely effecting my decision to return here for future trips.
minus^DONT GO THERE!!! I booked 2 rooms, one for 2 adults and one for 3 adults. However, I was provided 2 identical rooms (but charged USD 110.00 more for one the rooms) and was asked to sort this out later with booking.com; So far I am still waiting for a refund... Meanwhile the place is crammed with a noisy low-end clientele. Stay at ARIA instead, a million times better on all aspects.
plus^The view from our room was amazing and blackout curtains made sure we happily slept-in tip late, every day. Bliss...
minus^The staff were disconnected - very unconcerned with any issues I wanted resolved... Maybe it's hard to handpick good staff when you need so many of them (the hotel is h-u-g-e).  Room service was average...  Having to hire a fridge for our room was bad enough ($25 per day - could we not have used the bar fridge?), but it was old and ugly and arrived on a 4-tiered cracked plastic trolley. It was an eyesore, and they refused to rent us the fridge without the trolley... Odd...
plus^Large room, very clean and comfortable bed. Plenty of storage space. Wifi was strong. Air con was efficient and the price was excellent. As it was so cheap, we would stay here again but there are better places available for a little bit more money.
minus^We were charged a fee to check in early, I understand that there is a check in time for a reason but we have stayed at other MGM owned properties and this has never been charged before. Surely, if the room is ready they can just let you check in? Would have been nice to have tea and coffee making facilities in the room. Also not the best location on the strip, for a similar price you can be more central.
plus^We like the Service, We like the what I see.. We love the room and the view
minus^The Valet parking, Well it took us long time to get the Car on the First  but the Second time it better
plus^I stay here all the time and generally love this hotel and location but ...
minus^This time when I came to the room we had no robes and the in room products were not refreshed as the technology kit was already open and we had no access to water as it had not been restocked.
plus^The room and decor were very good. The hotel itself was well built so no noise from neighbours that you sometimes get in hotels.
minus^Very long check in queue  we thought it would be quieter after the holiday weekend
plus^Really comfortable and clean, nice staff, great location, Las Vegas spirit, good restaurants and bars.
minus^Room service is really bad. It takes a while to get your order ready.
plus^Great hotel in great location. You could spend your entire trip there and have no need to go out anywhere else! Plenty of choice for eating and drinking.
minus^Music around pool area was very loud when a bit of relaxation was needed.
plus^The Hotel was lovely, fabulous pools, great casino, great buzz about it.
minus^It was a little bit off the main stip. The room was miles away, the room was small and because of fire regulations they would not allow us a cot in the room(which they didn't tell us until we arrived). I made our little girl a bed on the floor to do the few days stay. We visited other hotels while there and was more impressed with them & they were cheaper too. I would stay here again but def not my first choice
minus^I didn't like  dealing  with reception when i paid for staying .. They promised to return deposit which is 300$ after few days .. I found out after 3 days they got 300$ more from my credit card !!! How does't come this . I'm going to complain about this
plus^Pools,
minus^Food Court, Crowd was rowdy , was staying on may 3rd. Access to strip from the room was far. Room view was not good. Room was not cleaned until late at night.
plus^Great dealers, desk staff, front bell staff and valets Garden arena setup is awesome.. food drink and restrooms easily accessible at full capacity
minus^Long walk to room Expensive rate for small room with view of a roof
plus^Nice view, good location, good room with nice bathroom. The hotel location is good on the strip, toward the south end. Casino facilities were good, and the breakfast buffet was nice.
minus^It was pretty noisy, I think due to being quite high up and with high winds outside. The aircon didn't help, though.
plus^I enjoyed the ambiance of the hotel there was a great mixture of people but everyone seemed to be on the same accord; party!
minus^The toilet did not flush properly
plus^room was nice and choice of dining was good
minus^smoke and noise in the casino lobby areas was  obnoxious, and the meal prices in the restaurants were exorbitant. $30 for a plate of pasta!? I am just not a Las Vegas fan, so I was never going to be thrilled with the big casino hotel concept. If you are, then have at it. The MGM Grand has lots of stuff for you!
minus^We booked a smoking room alomost a month ago and they didn't give us a smoking room when we checked in. The room they gave us wasn't cleaned properly either, there was a large empty pizza box in front of the door! I called guest services to complain, and they just said that they don't guarantee the room types even though they make reservations, and then she rudely said that if we smoked in the room we'll be charged a $350 fine.  What a great way to start a vacation!
plus^The staff was very nice and accommodating and helpful.  The room was quiet and comfortable.  We had a great time and slept very well.
minus^The organization of the building was a bit confusing.  Its location on the strip is okay but it is kind of all the way at one end of the strip so there is a lot of walking involved.
plus^Excellent pools. Experience of staying in a large Vegas hotel. Excellent shower in room.
minus^Checking in process takes too long. No coffee making facility in room
plus^Wolf gang puck restaurant food & service were excellent
minus^The hotel is out of date & tacky & the front desk screwed up our reservation giving our room away we had booked 3 months ago
plus^Liked the casino. Loved the gambling at mgm. Also loved the concierge service which guided us so well. Tower suite on 28th floor was amazing.
minus^There was no tea coffee machine in the room.
minus^We were not left any clean towels on the second day of our stay. Upon checkout, we were refunded our minibar fee and half of the resort fee. The staff were excellent.
plus^Great Service and excellent location on the strip.
minus^Don't touch the drinks on the refrigerator they have sensors on them and you will get charged. Wish there was just a regular refrigerator.
plus^The room had excellent views and was clean and very comfortable.
minus^Stayed at Signature at MGM Grand earlier on trip and facilities were much better and price was considerably lower.
plus^Loved the pool, the attentative service of the staff at the pool too.
minus^The rudeness of staff if not tipped. We stood in line for 10minutes waiting to hand our bags to a gentleman who was loading them to a luggage trolley. When we didn't tip him his mannerisms were discraceful.
plus^Size of room and bed
minus^Increase rate of room from day to day  For example 1st day as I booked from booking  but other day was increasing  by 100 -200 dollars
plus^The MGM Grand is an amazing resort with all of the major shows being presented at this venue. The nighclub is amazing with some of the best DJs in US playing. Caters for all types of food options for the customer. My request to delay my checkout time was accepted and I was provided with an additional Hour stay.
minus^Nothing note worthy.
plus^The woman at lost and found who helped us get our lost laptop back at 11pm she saved our lives! The rooms are amazing, nicely decorated, the very comfortable bed and atelier de Joel robuchon.. Magic
minus^A bit lost in this huge resort, long walk to parking, too many people at the pool.
plus^Very nice, attractive room at a reasonable price.
minus^Mixed drinks in bars are to expensive,12 to 15 dollars a drink. Electronic gambling machines are no fun.
plus^Nothing really. Just another copy-paste hotel on the las vegas strip.
minus^Expensive for standard quality. You can get same kind of room twice or three times cheaper. Extremely slow high speed internet wifi as they call it. Breakfast is not included in the room rate.  Buffet is overpriced for mediocre quality.
plus^Everything in one place
minus^West Wing horrible!  due to .... 1 - dark room, bring flashlight 2 - shower light went out twice 3 - need maintenance to turn on shower 4 - TV control box illuminates entire room with all lights off 5 - TV in bathroom does not work 6 - not enough towels for 2 people 7 - horrible internet / WiFi connection 8 - plug in hair dryer, blows fuse 9 - they lost our reservation, had Booking.com confirm e-mail to prove reservation Other than that - just GREAT  :)
plus^We didn't use the Resort Facilities, however we liked and enjoyed all of the above during the stay. It exceeded our expectations. 
minus^There are very limited seating arrangements inside the hotel - No chairs, sofas or benches to rest from walking Also, we called the Bell Service from our room to ask a question and the lady that answered sounded annoyed & was impolite, instead of trying to be helpful. 
plus^Location was great.
minus^Room was poor. Two lights didn't work. The shower had poor cleanliness, sink would not drain. Un sure if I would return to the MGM.
plus^Good location, comfortable
minus^Shower did not work.  They did not offer to fix or compensate us.   No service for the amount paid ($1000 per night)   Bell hop took over 1 hour to come to our room.   Anytime you call the front desk, they constantly put you on hold. Room service puts you on hold and when we called, 1.5 hour wait.
plus^Nice and up to date inside and out
minus^We went to pacquiao Bradley 2 fight and unfortunately had a horrible and dangerous experience trying to get out of Arena after the fight. We were jammed shoulder to shoulder, jammed against those in front of us and those behind us were jammed into us. We could hardly move at all for almost 1 hour.  There were 3 hotel staff standing in front of metal detectors, blocking anyone from getting through, which would have allowed 3 more lanes of people to get through.  I mentioned to them that they should let people through, that we were in danger of being trampled.  They didn't care nor would they speak to me. This turned one of the best sporting events I have ever been into a nightmare.  I do not understand how a hotel of this caliber would allow this to happen.  How dangerous was it? Ask the 60 people who got trampled after many weather fight in the exact same circumstance as Us. We almost got trampled ourselves by a large group of young men who were trying to shove their way through; I had to turn around and threaten every damn one of them to stop it from happening.  On they way out I spoke to a security guard and told him someone is going to get killed if they don't do something, he just looked at me without answer. I loved everything else about our stay but this just plain sucked.  I can't put it into word how bad it was, I felt like I was packed int a group of 15000 sardines.  Something has to change with your exit policy from the arena, too many doors are closed or locked, funneling people into a very small area.
minus^We were told we had a room at the 27th floor (as per my request). We made the check in and we were told we had the room at the 27th floor. When we went to take the keys they told us we were moved to a room on the 15th floor. I was complaining about the room with the receptionnist and she wanted to call the security.The staff is very very rude. I asked to speak with the manager who was even worst. It is the first time it happens something like that to me. I will not go and I do not suggest this hotel to anyone. When you pay so much you expect a good service. No complementary coffee in the rooms TERRIBLE
plus^The pool area was awesome. The room we had was very nice and had a great view! The staff was very friendly. The sushi restaurant  Shibuya was excellent and would definitely come back to it and have recommended it to other friends that are going to Vegas.
minus^At first we got a little lost getting to our room but we had help from a man who looked like a manager and he was very nice and helpful and even walked us to the right area. Once you walk around you get to know the place. Maybe maps should be handed out at check in, especially for new guests because the place is huge!
plus^Location was good. Room was big and clean
minus^Walls were too thin, we could hear the neighbours talking every night. Since the room was for more than one person, at least 2 luggage stands could have been provided.
plus^Clean large rooms, Close to airport..very close. Great food staff and gambling!
minus^Could not sleep in rooms, air was very dry!! I am a good sleeper and have never had this before!
plus^Very big hotel. It is like a small city. There is nice food court and shopping inside hotel. Nice casino and beautiful pool Back again and recommend to everyone
minus^Nothing to say.
minus^i have been trying to reach out to booking ,com . being a genius member and booked over 50 trips.  -  my stay was from Check in 5th Check out 8th in a suite. 5th was pre booked and informed to the hotel on the emial.  when i arrived on the 6th morning they had cancelled my booking and put me in a small little downgraded room.and charged me more.  Booking ,com needs to respond to me as a loyal customer.
plus^Nice hotel. Definitely would came back.  The room was brand new and amazing.
minus^I didn't get the room I was supposed to get. They switched me to another room (smaller) but for the inconvenience, didn't charge the hotel fee plus gave me 100 dollars credit in food. Would rather be upgraded to a better room, that's whats supposed to happen in this situations.   Anyway, It's all good MGM. Try honouring my confirmed reservation next time.
plus^Rooms were fantastic, so comfortable. 
minus^Such a huge scale hotel it wasn't a very personal experience. Check in time took 45 mins in a huge line. A luggage storage took another half an hour. 
plus^The best part was that they offered us a free upgrade from two bedrooms with king size beds to a two-bedroom special suite on 24th floor with excellent city view. It was our 3rd wedding anniversary and we loved being in the suite :)
minus^Nothing much but we noticed many empty glasses outside rooms in the hallway. Also, it would be great to at least include the coffee maker in the suite.
minus^The receptionist really mixed up all the reservation details and have some sarcastic comments how many times she has to tell customers about special conditions. 
plus^The MGM was a good location for the fight event. However, it was far from everything else and should provide shuttles. The rooms was very small for the money but the staff made up for the price by their kindness and helpfulness.
minus^The room and the Grand Buffet was not kept clean.
plus^Loved the hotel in general. It was gorgeous. Also loved the lunch buffet. fantastic value for money. was delicious. Wet republic is a must visit and also my first night so flyod mayweather, big bonus!!!! Loved the room, it was huge with big black out windows over looking the strip.
minus^the concierge was not truthful about the shows available. she did her best to sell KA and that was it KA was sorta disappointing The hotel was very cold the first few days i was there, by the second night they had sorted it out, but it was very cold compared to other hotels i walked through that same day.
minus^Quiet, clean, comfortable. Pools are gorgeous and there were plenty of chairs/towels, though drinks are sometimes hard to come by (few servers, bars far from pool area), great restaurants. Will definitely stay again!
plus^beds comfortable
minus^problems with wifi connection, water was off for a while, clerk did not activate my room key so once I got to the 8th floor I was locked out, over priced room
plus^On top of the strip and yet with easy access to other well-known resorts and casinos. Staff extremely friendly, check-in and check-out are most efficient. Rooms are well decorated and the bed was comfortable. Very good value for the room price we booked for.
minus^We were put in room 5xx in the west wing and the corridor is definitely long for people with luggage. the daily $28 resort fee is definitely a burden, especially for those who don't stay much inside the hotel.
plus^The room was clean and the housekeeping service good. Good location to expolore Las Vegas Strip.
minus^As booking.com guests we paid more than guests booking directly via hotel webpage. No fridge in the room & dark room with limited view. The walks within the hotel are endless, the cardio room (fitness) too small for such big hotel and the air in the casino  too close.
plus^Location is good, service is also ok.
minus^Too high price, and when we checked in, the room type is not the one we booked from the booking.com, which made them charged 20+$ more per night. Besides, the tax is 12%, which is much higher than the normal Las Vegas tax rate (8.1%)!
plus^The most amazing hotel room ever!  Got a king suit in the tower and it was simply gorgeous.  I've lived in apartments smaller than the bathroom.  Awesome pretty well describes it.
minus^Everything not in the room.  Too loud, too busy, too expensive, and losing all of my gambling allotment too quickly.
plus^Comfortable room and lovely pool.  Ideally situated on Las Vegas strip.
minus^Extortionate phone call prices. Over $70 for 2 very quick international calls.  Expensive buffet.
minus^It took us 45 minutes of standing in line hust to check in. Our room was tiny. The bathroom is basically in the room. There is NO privacy. It took literally 30 minutes to get hot water in the shower. The hallways were so cold we would shiver on our way to the elevator. And the air freshener they put in all the air ducts made me nauseous. We played on the main floor for hours and never once got offered a drink. We both left the hotel with sore throats and stuffy noses. It was not worth the money or the hassle. I may be grumpy and rating too harshly but I will never stay there again.
plus^The Poker Room The Whiskey Down (Particularly the bar staff)
minus^When my TV broke it took hours for someone to come and fix it. When I moved into my room it had no water supply.
plus^hotel nice, stuff nice, all look very nice...
minus^Open the window of the 4rth floor, I see a wall and a roof, no viwe bad room location, left the place....
plus^Walking out in Las Vegas and seeing the lights, other hotels  and restaurants. As for our hotel did not like anything apart from the shows which were extremely expensive, David Copperfield was amazing The Harley Davidson Restraunt food and drink was excellent value for money.
minus^The room was little more than a box, the bathroom is exactly as you enter the room meaning that even with the security catch on the door if you are just out of the shower anyone attempting to enter (maid, maintenance etc) can see into the bathroom area immediately. Would never return to this hotel. Staff only had interest in you if you were gambling, if you do not tip the girl providing the free drinks everytime then you will not recieve another. No additional privilages for residents so go stay in another nicer hotel, there are many and cheaper.
plus^Our room, an Executive Queen, was perfect for our family of four, and the price was amazing, through Booking.com.  We happened to be on the Stay Well floor, which meant Vitamin C infused showers, natural lighting, room humidifier, aromatherapy, nature sounds machine, UV-exposed linens (to remove germs),etc.  Very large bathroom also was great, with a separate shower, AND a bath/shower combo.  The bathroom even had a natural lighting options on the light-up mirrors.  Staff was always professional and courteous, many dining options, and pool complex - the reason we stayed there - was top notch.
minus^Our television frequently lost its signal, and would be down for 30 seconds at a time - should NOT happen in a hotel.  Also, remote stopped working on one TV (that's right, we had two...), and it was due to a loose connection on the back that took two attempts to fix.
plus^Overall was a great stay.  Beds were very comfortable.  Pool Area was excellent.  Staff were always helpful to answer any questions we had.
minus^Dissappointed that we could not pay $20.00 for a late check-out as they offer an early check-in for $20.
plus^The hotel is magnificent. The amenities are state of the art. It trumps more expensive hotels around the world.Lots to do. And of course... on the strip! Valet parking was very efficient.
minus^Watch out for the resort tax and resort fees and a host of other fees and taxes. Add about a third to you quote!
plus^The location was awesome, clean rooms, comfortable bedding and friendly staff. Once off the ground floor the living was super comfortable. Ice machine not too far on same floor. Huge hotel.. Got lost a few times but it was worth it. Didn't mind exploring. Can't count how many Starbucks the hotel had lol. Love the decor. I would definitely revisit.
minus^The smokey casino. I felt like I left there with lung cancer. There must be a construction plan in the future to seperate the smokers and non smokers. Not ideal for family vacations. You have to walk through the casino to get anywhere in the building. Even while shopping or dining you were subjected to second hand smoke. Also the surcharge for using the fridge or minibar in your room was insane. Do not touch the snacks or open the fridge! Besides that I would definitely revisit.. I'll pack a vaporizer to recharge my lungs for the next trip through the lobby.
plus^It is the first time that we are in a hotel like that, so it is amazing, surprising, absolutely different to the rest, so it is difficult to classify it as a hotel.
minus^Nothing specific to the hotel, but to the kind of hotel. How to have breakfast among gaming machines, for example? Everything is inside, nothing outside, and huge, easily lost, specially with kids. Among the degenerative ambiance of las Vegas the hotel suits very well, but after visiting the quietness of Grand Canyon, Monument Valley and many other wonders of the Arizona and Utah nature, Las Vegas is just the contrary: waste of energy, ridiculous, pathetic, trying to imitate in a single street the rest of the word. The competition among hotels for the most eccentric attractions (gondolas, Eiffel tour, etc.) it is simply crazily yokel. They won't see me there anymore.
plus^So much to do in one place!  Could have stayed there the whole trip!
minus^Took a while to check in.  only 3 people working/checking people in however there were about 5 other people standing behind the counter just talking while there was a line of people waiting to check in. Why does the pool close so early?  Would have loved to take a swim and have a cocktail at the end of the day.
plus^Great location, great window coverings, staff was marvelous.  Top notch service.
minus^We stayed at the signature timeshares as well - I wouldn't bother.  You don't get the same amenities that you would in the actual grand and it's a decent walk to casino.
plus^The hotel has so many restaurants to choose from, a great pool and- for my kids- even better was the lazy river.  The room we had was spacious and comfortable with nice colors and design. When we requested extra bedding it arrived promptly.  And when we requested a late check out they were very accommodating and it was inexpensive and easy.
minus^The line for checking in took 30 minutes- I have never seen a line like it at a hotel check in before.  The staff member who checked me in said it was usually like that.  I think that means there should be more agents checking people in. When we got to our room and took our shoes off there was a wet- soaking wet- area on the rug outside of the bathroom (not near a sink or shower at all).  When I called about it I was told that they had probably spot cleaned an area and not dried it properly and that they could send someone up with a blower to dry it. Not exactly restful vacation time as I would have to stay for that.  So I declined and piled towels on it so that the wetness could not seep through.  Later someone knocked on my door- maintenance to repair the television-- but I hadn't even turned on the TV and so sent him away.  I received a follow up call about the TV and the person explained that maybe the housekeeping or previous guest had called about the TV.   My thought was that if that were the case, it should have been repaired before we checked in.
minus^Too big. Too far to walk to get to the room. Also, only had a view of the roof of the casino. We were on the same level as the roof and had vent stacks right in front of our window. Not attractive at all. The distance from the elevator to the room was ridiculous.  Also, too much smoke throughout the hotel.
plus^Lazy River at the Pool
minus^Rooms were unkept, shower was scolding, sheets were totally scratchy, this was our 3rd time at MGM and I won't be going back.
plus^Great location,  excellent value for money. Nice compact rooms with lovely linen and comfy bed.
minus^Great distance between west wing and pool area, having to pass through casio floor to get there.
plus^Loved the room! Excellent staff and very clean. The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms were amazing.  All of the amenities available in the hotel made you not even want to step outside.  Definitely staying there again!
minus^Wish I knew the resort fees upfront.
plus^The room was just fantastic. The bed extremely comfortable. I felt very safe and comfortable
minus^The pool is way too far from the rooms I have to travel from one end to the other
plus^cleanliness, friendliness and the fact MGM hosts all the fights!
minus^the maid in the early morning knocked on the door waking people up knowing check out is later in the morning
plus^No elevator use to go to the room !!
minus^I was offered an upgrade to a better room for a certain cost !! I accepted , when I was doing my check in , I mentioned it to the girl and she did not care ! She gave an upgrade that we tought was much worse room ! But with an exc location !
minus^Great service and hotel. I got a free room upgrade when I arrived and got to check out late at no charge. Nice room and view as well. Lots to see and do even within the hotel. Free parking and monorail access to get up and down the vegas strip were great.
plus^everything was fabulous loved it would definitely stay again and would recommend to friends and fam
minus^casino service poor sat way to long waiting on drinks waitress's would offer and not bring anything at all
plus^the room as done very nice.
minus^We asked them 4 times to open the mini bar and they never did. They claimed the sent someone to open it and but it as locked everytime we got to th room for 3 days. They didn;t care.
plus^Big room and nice front desk, smiley face, located at the most interested street in the city.
minus^There was no in-house coffee maker, you have to get down for that, while the hotel is rated as 4-star hotel
minus^We were lucky enough to be upgraded at no extra cost.  The suite was luxurious and fantastic.  The check in staff were particularly helpful.  Everything was exceptional.
plus^Close to all food outlets, activities and shopping especially being on the strip where it all happens!  The rooms were large and the bathroom extra large which we loved.  The rooms were clean and the cleaning staff the MGM need to be congratulated for keeping it immaculate!   There were plenty of food outlets and activities within the hotel to take part in and it wasn't too far to walk to the other hotels like the Excalibur, Luxor and the Mandalay thanks to the pedestrian bridges linking the hotels and the free tram from the Excalibur to the Mandalay and Luxor.   Walking up and down the strip there were plenty of activities and shows like the Bellagio dancing fountain show and the Volcano show at the Mirage.
minus^The smoking inside the casino was the downside to the entire trip especially with small children.  Surely they can do something to better regulate the air! Parking on the strip isn't so great so its far better to walk but that isn't a bad thing - you can work off all the food!
plus^Professional staff, good location on strip, lovely modern and very clean rooms, modern compared to other hotels on strip, many restaurants and entertainment areas on site, decent internet, good tv, fast elevators, nice bathroom, safe in room.
minus^Pricey considering very little is included in the room price. For instance, you cannot use the minibar for your own items..they expect you to hire another fridge for 25$ a day!! Internet costs after a time period, no breakfast or even 1 drink included, pools outside/far away, restaurants way overpriced, not enough clothes shops inside.
plus^Upon arrival we were given an upgrade in our room because they could not accommodate us with 2 adjoining rooms as we were traveling with our teenage children.  The suite we were given had 2 king beds, the acknowledged our needs without us asking by providing us with a roll away bed for one of our children. Room was beautiful, large and clean.  I felt the location was very convenient because public transportation and/or the free tram made it easy to get anywhere in the strip.  While the hotel/casino is extremely large, you had all of your needs right at your disposal.  I would definitely stay at the MGM grand again.
minus^There seemed to be a sewer smell that came from the toilet, however you could only smell it in the bathroom.
plus^The housekeeping staff were very friendly!
minus^The fast food restaurants were awful and very expensive. Not very much variety or worth the buck at all....The hotel room was not very clean and the west wing looks very poor and needs remodeling and was over rated.
plus^Kyle on reception was friendly and helpful
minus^Noise, smoke, crowds in casino (which you have to walk through) Average room, but no tea/coffee making facilities. Have to pay $18 for a cup of coffee via room service!
plus^Always wanted to stay at MGM, I think it's an iconic part of the strip. The lobby offered great people watching.  Location was excellent for all the things we wanted to do. Our check in was fast and the front desk agent was very welcoming.
minus^There was a strange odor coming from the bathroom sink, something strange was going on with the pipes.  After the room was serviced, we noticed the housekeeper was kind enough to plug it. Other than that everything else was good.
minus^I was upset with booking.com because I was under the impression I was going to have rooms with 2 queen beds but the reservation was made with 1king bed in each room. So when I arrived I had to pay an extra $30 per room per night for the 2 queen beds in each room.
plus^Casino, Starbucks.. Shops .. Crouded with people and Fun.
minus^No Coffee machine inside the room, bath water is not so strong to make a good bath, No indoor Jacuzzi.
plus^The MGM is a fantastic location and convenient to travel to the convention center.
minus^I warm shower is all I ask for when traveling for business.  I did not get one and the staff didn't seem surprised.
plus^I like the hotel, we stayed there before. The location is great and facilities are very enjoyable.
minus^The beds need to be replaced - our mattress had two big dips that made sleeping not comfortable. Also the shower head did not work properly, just trickling. Fortunately the utility shower head work ok.
minus^at 8:40am someone knocked at the door and i did not answer it because i was sleeping. to my surprise,a lady opened the door and walked in.  i was scared and i called the front desk and the security. no one appologized because they told me that it was housekeeping staff and it was very common. in las vegas, everyone went to sleep very late and the check out time is 11:00am. do you think 8:40am is a common pratise to make the cleaning job?
plus^Great staff that helped us out with whatever was needed. Pool area was great and the room/suite we had was world class.
minus^The casino floor seemed more smokie than a lot of the others.
plus^We received a complimentary room upgrade on arrival. Bed was super comfy & room was a good size. Great location on the strip. Lots of shops, restaurants & other things to see & do in the hotel. Pool is awesome!
minus^If only they would change the law to stop people smoking inside!!!! The air fresher they use to disguise the smell is equally as terrible. It was hard to breath & gave me a sore throat. We opted for a non smoking room but could still smell the smoke through the air conditioning vents.
plus^I liked it that the lift lobby was not miles away from the main lobby. Stayed at Belliago and had to walk 20mins to get to the room everytime! Liked also the guy who checked me in, He was great and understanding that I had long flight and take it to himself to call me in 20mins (instead of 3hours) and gave me a room.
minus^Buffet did not have a lot of vegan choices...could have done better on that field. Paid 21$ but ate pratically  nothing.
minus^Perfect Vegas trip!  food was wonderful, each staff member - at the restaurants, check-in and housekeeping -  were all very helpful and the friendliest dealers in town.  the perfect vegs trip.
plus^* excellent room, big room, big bathroom * free wifi * location is great (very important to choose a gd location hotel in vegas, coz the mainly transport is.....by walk, unless u would like take taxi in bewteen) * classic grand hotel in vegas but in reasonable price * all staff are very friendly n helpful, we had a great stay as this is our first time travel in vegas
minus^* grand canyon day trip is overprice if book via hotel * weak water pressure in bath room
plus^Beds were comfortable, large rooms, express checkout, lots of resturants and coffee shops.
minus^Noise as you can clearly hear people walking in corridors. Resort fee is high and it did not include the spa.
minus^Hotel staff was excellent.. Front desk staff got me a beautiful room, and also got to check in 3 hours early. I was most impressed by the Doorman, they really take care of the hotel guest. I had to attend a wedding off the strip, in a residential area. The Doorman had to ask 3 different cabs to make sure they knew where they where going. He didn't want those cabbies to give me the run around and get ripped off and take me somewhere I'm not suppose to be. The Doorman was telling me some of there cabs only know one route, airport & hotel. Anyway, Big Mahalo's MGM staff you folks are the best.. I definitely will stay with you folks again my next trip to Las Vegas. Thanks again.
plus^Nothing.  The entire stay was miserable.
minus^We had to wait 45 minutes to check in.  There were so many people in the Starbucks line because it  was so long that we finally gave up and drove to McDonalds after waiting for 1/2 an hour to get coffee and food because  food was so outrageously priced. $14 for a waffle. People partying and yelling outside our door all night long.  Horrible 80's music blaring loudly throughout the hotel- you could not even carry on a conversation or hear yourself think.  (How about some Jazz or something classy?).  I had a dispute over my deposit and when I called to resolve it the girl was so rude, and laughed at me so I had to speak to a supervisor.  Hairs in the corners of the bathroom.  Disgusting.  I will NEVER stay at this hotel again.
plus^room was modern with good facilities
minus^Smoking.. The air inside the casino was filled with smoke which  effected my health and made me quiet ill at times. I had breathing problems as a result and required medication to assist with the poor air quality in the casino.
plus^Still the best casino and great restaurants. We has a strip view suite and it was just fantastic to be there.
minus^When we arrived having booked a suite we were told there were none available in smoking so we would have to change room type (no way being in vegas was a good time to cut down).  We were offered the choice of paying the upgrade on the bill or giving a cash tip to the supervisor and getting it comped. I told the reception staff that is just plain bribery and got half the room comped to hush me up. Bad practice at a big hotel and not the best star to the holiday.
plus^The location was great given that I was there for the PAC 12 basketball tournament.  The hotel and room were in good condition and my stay was enjoyable.
minus^There were many problems with internet access that were all on the hotel side.  What made it worse was a general lack of responsiveness and accountability.  The concierge and the front desk tried to pass it off as not their issue.  Yes, MGM outsourced the WiFi upkeep to a third party but at the end of the day my impression is of the hotel and not the lousy outside service provider.  Easy and reliable access to the internet is an expectation of nearly every guest in a nicer hotel so I hope MGM decides to solve this issue.
minus^I stayed on the phone to the front desk for 30 minutes trying to get a late checkout Went down to the front desk and ask for an hour extra stay and was told no way was told  You needed to be out by 11 all I was asking for an extra hour !! So the front desk staff was not my favorite person and he had an attitude !!! Would I stay at the MGM again I don't know he left me with a very bad feeling of not knowing customer service
plus^Service Style Flexibility Location
minus^Smoking inside the lobby and casino, however this is a country policy I suppose. Bad air in the hotel, however, again this has to do with the necessity of the air conditioning.
plus^Don't stay here. It is not good value for money. Look for a deal at the Belagio!
minus^Service Room Wifi did not work Very expensive for not much Casino and Hotel stinks of smoke!!!
minus^The check in clerk was very rude. I had booked the room using my nickname, which isn't the name on my credit card. He nearly denied us the room because of this. Not a great first impression!!
minus^A couple more friends joined us at the last minute so we needed an upgrade. I asked when I checked in, he left to talk to his manager and returned letting me know we definitely got the upgrade with no extra charge. Excellent customer service! I will stay at the MGM the next time I'm in Las Vegas.
plus^Perfect location. The smallest room (Double standard) was spacious enough. Comfy bed. Spotlessly clean shower, thick and soft bath towels. Nice lady at the business-center. Extremely polite and helpful staff at the concierge desk, personal thanks to Ms. J.Duleba for her recommendations.
minus^Rude reception clerks. Low-skilled dealer at the casino.
minus^Housekeeping did a poor job of cleaning the rooms . The young girl that check me in did not know what she was doing . It was a horrible stay , I rather spend more money at a better place
plus^The staff here is excellent.  My room was fantastic, modern, clean and comfortable.  Room service was prompt and the food hot.  Perfect location for playing on the strip!
minus^Leaving
plus^Room was clean and modern. Staff was very responsive and attentive. Central location.
minus^By its nature it is a huge resort / casino and once you're on the main floor it is super crowded and hard to find an exit. If you're looking for a relaxing tranquil place – stay somewhere else. Also the hotel in general is a bit dated, there are signs of wear and tear and it smells like smoke in the hallways and main floor.
plus^We received a wellness room as a free upgrade, and we loved it. From the bathroom lighting to the fresh air and overall comfort of the room. Very nice. .
minus^The bed corners and the baskets under the sink in the bath room. I kicked those baskets 50 times and the bed corners at least the same. The baskets are a good idea but need to be further back. The bed corners are deceiving because your eyes focus on the bed, but your leg will hit the protruding corners.
plus^I liked the location and variety of restaurants in hotel and in nearby walking distance. We found Hechos Mexican restaurant in the hotel excellent if you like mexican food. One entrée order will probably serve two. We found the room one of the newer or recently updated rooms for a very reasonable cost. Room was quiet in the West wing but quite a way to travel to get to main lobby. 
minus^Check in was confusing. The address given and entered in gps was on Las Vegas Blvd., However the actually entrance is on Tropicana Blvd. We ended up parking in self parking, having to make 2 trips to car to get luggage to our room as well as the one trip to check in. One should remember they have free valet parking. We were impressed with room upon check in but after staying the first night discovered some flaws, ie. There wasn't a bath exhaust fan for the shower or toilet to remove steam or odors, limited counter space in bath, and when one opened the shower door to retrieve a towel or dry off you were totally exposed to common hallway should another person be entering at the same time. The closet was much too large for only 2-3 nights stay, would like to have more bathroom space instead. Having said this, I would stay at the hotel again but upgrade to a grand king room. The booking of this particular room was due to me not knowing and not having stayed there before, and relying on what was posted on line. Sounded like a good value at the time. 
plus^Decor
minus^We paid extra for a suite.  On arrival found our room overlooked the airport.  The windows are not double glazed and therefore the noise of the helicopters constantly taking off was a factor.  On the first morning we were woken at 8am by the noise.  When we complained we were eventually given a quitter room overlooking the car park.  Huge resort and therefore are treated by the staff as just another number.
plus^Best hotel in LV. Very clean and quiet, big rooms with nice view, free valet parking.
minus^My car was hard scratched when it was in valet parking and no one said about this accident.  Nobody apologized. It's terrible!
plus^Staff was outstanding and always friendly.
minus^Signage directing guest to North Tower were limited and vague.  Similarly there seems to be two West Towers!?
plus^Location good, sushi restaurant near the lobby is very good.
minus^Room is very small, corridors are scary too long and tiny and way to my room was confusing as i had to transfer from one lift to another to reach my room. Nothing available in the room like water, coffee, bath slipper, even shampoo we had to ask for it. Quiet messy!!!!!!
minus^Just got back from our stay at the MGM Grand. We were a day late arriving due to our connecting flight from philadelphia being cancelled due to snow. We contacted the  MGM and informed them of our situation, they said it was not a problem. Upon arrival the staff on reception informed us that as the delay was not our fault we would not be charged for the missed night ( 3 Rooms ).  They then informed us that our rooms had been upgraded free of charge , no reason was given but the upgrades were very much appreciated.  Brilliant staff, huge hotel, loads to do,  would recommend this hotel to anyone.
plus^Location, food options, and entertainment options were diverse
minus^Technology including the safe, tv, and internet didn't work.  The response times to fix anything were abhorrent and ineffective. David Copperfields show was like something Forman old ALF rerun that hadn't been updated since ALF was on tv.  The show was dated and unimpressive - there was just no wow.
minus^I found that MGM was very people friendly. I enjoyed my stay there very much.  I stayed a few nights later at another big hotel and it was not as pleasant as MGM.  I will tell people of the accommodations and of the people friendly staff and delicious food we found there.
plus^Nice size of a room, comfortable jacuzzi
minus^You have to call many times and ask what they show you on the pics of the room on the website. They call it Located for aesthetic purposes...Slow wifi, which could stop any time, but we were compensated for that.
plus^starbucks employees were very friendly. Staff in the italian restaurant were very good and pleasant
minus^dark dingy rooms.  rude wait staff almost impossible to navigate around the hotel/casino.
minus^Everything! The staff were amazing,esp Joey, she found out we were on honeymoon&really could not do enough for us.Location was ideal, free underground parking, excellent Buffet&Restaurants.Hotel was well sign posted so it was very easy to get around even tho it was so big.We went to other hotels while there and each time were so grateful we were staying in the MGM, could spend a week in Vegas & Never leave The MGM
plus^The bed was very comfortable. The shower was amazing . Lots of water pressure and hot water.
minus^The bathroom set up didn't leave any room to put stuff
plus^Very Central, comfortable room, courteous staff
minus^The front desk staff told me he was giving me a room with a good view of the strip but I felt it could have been better. I had to sign-in to the wifi every time and had to call support sometimes to get it working
plus^we were able to leave our luggage while we went to the grand canyon and staff very efficient and no fuss was made.
minus^there was no fridge in the room and to have one was $25 per day. Our room had not been cleaned properly when we arrived - found an empty chip packet under a chair.
plus^Clean, staff, and location
minus^The rooms were too loud you could hear people opening and closing their doors all night. They are not very sound proof. I've stayed at a ton of places and never heard anything all night. Very disappointed..
plus^Reasonable wifi, leaving
minus^It's a dump.  This must be reviewed by people who think a travelodge is a nice weekend away.  No class, no service, no way should this be reviewed good/excellent.   Booked 5 nights left after 1.  Book at the encore wyn instead.  Please do yourself a big favour.
plus^Very nice clean room
minus^I felt I was tricked by booking.com, I was quoted a price(even at first I thought was too high) when I arrived I was charged 100 $ more, with a 200$ security. I feel I should have been made aware of al this up front, I do not like suprises,When we watched TV the signal would fade in and out , the lights over the bed did not work properly
minus^The reception gentleman that booked us in was amazing wish I could remember his name! He gave us all the info we asked for I even invited him for a drink with us which unfortunately never happened due to us. Great room great service in room dining!
plus^Location, options for fine dining, most of staff service was great. When checking in they only had 1 room and had to scramble to find another. Even after I called ahead to confirm!  But they did solve the issue!
minus^When the ice machine broke and created a pool of water making me slip and require surgery 2 days later was the   .  Point ever while traveling (especially the way they decided to handle their screw up). Passed sobriety tests. Was not a drunken accident; rather a poorly maintained machine that was very old & always breaking down (head of security's words NOT mine!).
plus^Location because we attended a concert at the hotel.
minus^We failed to being any money home! Would have liked to see some 5$ black jack tales but they didn't exist.
plus^Quality of the room facilities such as TV, sheets, bed etc. was excellent.
minus^Not good value for money; we stayed in two hotels in Vegas and MGM was double the price, a third the room size and less central. The gym and casino were a huge walk from our room, which made it hardly worthwhile staying there. And the fuse shorted in the room, so we had no electricity in the morning.
minus^Horrible room.  Such bad ergonomics.  Weird light placement, hard to find switches, very little bathroom counter space, shower door, toilet door, etc.  Horrible smell, even for Vegas, through-out the casino.
plus^Excellent stay, the Hotel's location is perfect to explore the strip, the rooms are very comfortable and clean, so very good value for money
minus^Check-in lines are very long, I felt I was back at the airport arrival line (when you have to present your passport+visa when landing in the US).
plus^The service.  When we complained they did make changes for us.
minus^The SMELL!  They pump some kind of perfume smell into the casino area.  It was overwhelming.
plus^The rooms are very nice, we had a great view.  The are large and very well cleaned every day.  It is in a great location on the strip and there are lots of restaurants, bars and nightclubs right in the hotel.
minus^The hotel is absolutely massive and it took about ten minutes just to get out every day.  The hotel smelled musty and was filled with smoke on the casino floors which was disgusting.  The aircon did not seem to work properly which gave the hotel an overall dirty feeling.  There are a lot of charges added at check in which makes the stay a lot more expensive.
minus^There was some miscommunication between booking.com and front desk. They didn't get my modified reservation. I was so upset because they give me a receipt of 1st reservation. When I checked in, front desk person already know my reservation modified. But, when I check out, the front desk did not know that. So, when I asked that wrong misinformation..
plus^King exec room location and room in general nice but amazed at absence of coffee or tea making items.
minus^Even though I made the hotel and Booking. com particularly aware with email upon booking that we required close rooms due to young children with us we were as far apart as we could have been (10 mins brisk walk) resulting in myself staying with my eldest son in the 'basement'  room leaving my wife and two younger kids the other end of a vast huge and overly busy hotel full of questionable people. After a stupid amount of time (hour)  queuing to just check in (don't make the hotel so big if you can't handle the check in on a busy holiday) then the receptionist pointed out that the rooms I ordered were in different buildings ie Queen and King Exec...so why wasn't I told this when emailing I wanted close rooms then I could have booked two kings etc.. .... So in all.... Disappointed.
plus^Decor of room super nice professional staff that smiled and cared for the guests of the hotel location on the las vegas strip 
minus^Rip off extra charge to check in before 3pm rip off resort fees that did not even cover a gym entrance 12 cardio machines, that were free, for 5,000 guests...needless to say, packed at 530 am.. Terrible views from virtually the entire hotel over their pipes on the roof below, not seen on their web site that shows adjacent hotels jusy out the window ridiculous low sided bathtubs impossible to soak in and enjoy a bath.. Rip off meal prices everywhere you turned... 
plus^Apart from a small hick-up when we checked in everything was great.
minus^After we had checked in we walked into a room that hadn't been cleaned yet. But after a call to front desk we got a different room on the same floor and were told the room keys had been switched over. Unfortunately that wasn't the case so I had to walk back down to reception and get new keys. And I was told that the information I got about the room keys switching over was incorrect. For the inconvenience we got credit for food and beverage put on the room.
plus^Very comfortable.
minus^There were no good directions to get to different parts of the hotel. The one provided didn't include the exit onto the Strip so we walked out of the entrance where we arrived and down to the strip before we realized there was a much shorter route.
plus^Free WiFi everywhere, great Mlife loyalty program, Joel To by chin is a restaurant to try when you're in the hotel.
minus^I was disappointed in general, I've heard it's a great hotel, so I booked king executive. While being spacious, the room felt old. The view was close to nothing - six floor, seeing a roof next to you. For a 5 star hotel I would expect bathrobes - nada. I have also asked for a cup of hot tea. They said they'll bring a pot for 12 bucks within an hour. I refused.
plus^Was on promo, good price. Location is fine.
minus^Cheap bed and pillows, blanket without duvet cover in the normal form (just a cheap sheet under the blanket).
plus^Overall ok rooms and good location.
minus^Took over an hour to check in. The signs are terrible. There is a second entrance to the West Wing rooms but the signs to find it are very unclear. No bathrobe or slippers in the room.
minus^I was a guest at the mgm Grand in Las Vegas, January 9th thru 12th 2014. After a little sightseeing I returned to my room and preparing to get into bed I noticed that the bed covering was dirty and had hair on it. I am also traveling with 10 other women and at least two others had the same problem in their room. I waited for 30 minutes for someone to come and change the bed covering and finally I went to the front desk to make them aware of my situation, they apologized for the inconvenience and waived 1 day of resort fee ($25). When I returned to my room housekeeping came and did not remove the dirty bed covering but placed another bed covering folded on top of the dirty one. I went back to the front desk and spoke with a manager who called housekeeping and said that they must have misunderstood what I was saying. I personally don’t see how they misunderstood what I was saying because when I called the front desk initially I told them that the bed covering was dirty and had hair on it. I expressed to the manager my level of disappointment because this is a very disgusting situation. The fact that there is a dirty bed covering on the bed in the first place is enough to dissuade any person from wanting to return to this hotel but then the fact that housekeeping came and literally placed a clean bed covering on top of a dirty one shows a significantly low level of cleanliness and to expect a guest to remove a dirty bed covering that never should have been on the bed in the first place is terrible customer service. I have never stayed at a hotel not even a cheap hotel that expects the guests to change their own linen! There was no offer to change rooms or compensate me for my inconvenience, other than refunding one day of the resort fee which does not compensate for the level of disgust and discomfort that I now feel about staying at this hotel. 
minus^It seems they charge me USD100.80 more, they told me they will pay it back to my credit. But I still not get it. Because I have prepaid USD100.80 to booking. But when they do not deduct this amount in the balance.
plus^This was my first time in Vegas and I loved it. The MGM was a great hotel and met all are needs. We went to all the other hotels as far as the Caesars, in one direction and the Mandalay Bay the other direction. We saw the aquarium at the Mandalay Bay and loved it, We road the roller coaster at New York New York that was fun. A lot to do and see in Vegas. Can't wait to go there again. I can tell every one that the MGM is a great place.
minus^I should of checked who was going to be performing in Vegas before I booked my room. Fleetwood Mac, Steve Miller Band and The Doobie Brothers were going to be there right after we left. That was my fault no one else. But I know better now. That is the only thing I can say bad.
plus^The room was excellent, clean, spacious, comfortable.
minus^TV reception was spotty, kept loosing signal.  Internet access was bad plus we had to pay extra for it, are you kidding me?  Pay extra for internet access at a Resort where you are already paying a daily Resort Fee, what does the Resort Fee cover?  Overall did not like my stay because of these service issues.  The hotel/resort has some work to do to be first class.
plus^Express checkout saved us from waiting in line. Great system.  Staff were very courteous and helpful. I would definitely stay there again.
minus^Wifi was very intermittent and didn't work 40 percent of the time over our 6 day stay. Frequently had to re-log in several times a day and it still wouldn't work.
plus^Everything! We were in the grand tower 18th floor room 338. Views were unbelievable and perfect for Stu who had not seen vegas prior. Staff friendly and helpful. The service they have of connecting to restaurants in mgm worked well. This might be at the end of the strip but nothing a stroll doesn't fix or hop on the bus near the side entrance and for $8 you have 24 hour access to the bus!  Wolfgang puck at MGM had delicious food and great cocktails with impressive service. 
minus^Nothing! Definitely will stay here again. 
plus^great value for money
minus^randomly charging credit card several times, for deposits for city tax, for boarding, and your site says charge is due on arrival
plus^You don't have to leave the hotel. Everything is in the building (casino, lots of restaurants, etc.)
minus^Way too american for me. The hotel is like a factory.
plus^Everything was all in one food, gamble, night events! Great location on the strip!
minus^There was NO mention even when I called about a deposit per night. We did not get the room we paid for we got the down graded room. We came in earlier on a flight and they offered us a downgraded room at a ridiculous price instead if what they told me over the phone and we had to stay 1 night about (8 hrs) at Hooters across the street until MGM let us check in. We requested a late check out they gave us an hour longer (12PM) when we asked for longer they said it would be a full day charge. We had a late flight so they didn't work with us at all on customer service. House keeping knocks over and over at you door too even if you have the party mode on pause hanging from your door. Honestly wouldn't stay here again.
minus^Was not warned of resort fee and then given a different room than advertized. Also no resort ammenities given. I was very displeased with room and for the price I could of stayed elsewhere for better room and lower price.
plus^The stay well rooms are wonderful, the service ( with the exception of the check-in staff on duty the night we checked in) was exceptional as always. I have stayed at MGM many times and this was the first time it failed in even a minor way. It was not a deterrent, next time I will still book at MGM because they continue to be an outstanding experience. The new restaurant Hecho was fantastic! The food was delectable and the wait staff was exemplary!
minus^Upon check-in there was some confusion regarding the billing of the hotel stay. The staff member was extremely rude. She was unable to accurately explain the billing, instead of offering to have her manager assist in explaining something she clearly did not have the knowledge to explain, she displayed an attitude and was very rude. Eventually she sought out the manager who was very professional and in fact provided a reasonable explanation. Minor issues were non-working lamp in room that was not fixed in the 4 nights we stayed, and the black out shades that were stuck in the up position. Hopefully these issues will be addressed and not an issue the next visit.
plus^Very comfy and large room. Perfect location 
minus^Cleaning lady ringing at 9 and at 10 on the check out day was inappropriate. Dont forget to put the do not disturb sign ! Trouble in accessing the free wifi as well. 
plus^The Hotel is great and the staff are really helpful. The queues were a bit crazy in the hotel, but that is a Vegas norm.
minus^I requested a room close to the Lobby but instead was given a room on the other side of the hotel. This I was specific about when I booked my room. I stayed in the hotel for this specific reason, otherwise I would have chosen another hotel.
plus^Car Park free 
minus^1 hour queue in foyer to get to reception. Hundreds of people in queue .My credit card did not work. Refused to accept cash initially as deposit .I had to ring uk to credit card company to get card reactivated. No public phones. Two minutes on room phone cost $115 which is scandalous. 1 hour queue when leaving. Impossible to find West Tower even with map. Took 1 hour to find our room. 
plus^Great location. You can very busy stay inside all day long. Fantastic connection to other resort hotels near-by, plus buses etc. Food 24/7.
minus^Vending machines on the floor didn't have pop product.
minus^I had the reservation for 2000 USD For two rooms . Including tax it said on booking .. Despite no extra expenses at the hotel we paid more than 2500 USD . I want the difference back !!
plus^very professional staff, a lot of stuff to do in the hotel and around it, nice casino, beautiful and clean rooms and very comfortable
minus^its in the beginning of the strip so a lot of walk to everything. people who don't want to walk a lot will be in trouble... the hotel itself and its facilities including the buffet is very expensive and also there was a huge 3 hour line to the buffet which was a big drag
plus^The view was the only nice thing about the room.
minus^There was noisy construction going on throughout the majority of the day and night. Our traveling friends were inconveniently moved from their room, locked out of their new room for hours and ultimately  were so upset with the service they had to change hotels.
plus^Have stayed there now 4-5 times & always had a beautiful view of the strip!!
minus^Requested a room with a view of strip & received the view of Valet & Hooters. We stay in our rooms & relax & just enjoy strip view. Not so much with  recent view?
minus^-Horrible room with a very little window, very claustrofobic -Entrance to rooms on west tower  looks like a service entrance, with a long narrow aisle -Intenet very slow
plus^I liked that the Hotel was upscale yet not too classy. It was very busy I really enjoyed the atmosphere.
minus^My room was not ready until 4:15 when they told me 3:00. I really didn't like waiting around for over an hour.
plus^Great location, so much to do at the hotel you wouldn't need to leave! And. Close to all other major hotels on the strip. Will stay again
minus^Our bathtub overflowed one morning with black sludge that stunk SO BADLY! People came to the room within 15 minutes to fix, though in my opinion a hotel of that size should have had staff there within 5 min. The smell was so bad we have to leave the room for several hours
plus^The price you pay for , for what you get, spacious rooms, clean & great location!!
minus^Gym available is only cardio,  The line up for check in & check out way too long!!
plus^I liked the numbers of restaurants available to choose from.
minus^The long hallway towards the rooms if you happen to be assigned at the end of the hallway.
plus^the shows and facilities in hotel
minus^Not avery child friendly hotel we arrived from UK and children were obviously on second day on a different time zone so were up at 2am security came to the door and was aggresive which was out of order kids were just playing because they couldnt sleep no tea or coffee in the room which is standard in UK found that very strange
plus^It has a grandeur reputation and it certainly lived up to the hype. Amazing complex, if your not into gambling there is so much else to do including intense exercise just to get around the mammoth interior!
minus^Slightly pricey restaurants and food halls but I suppose it fits well with the title! In room snack / drink selection atrociously priced.
plus^The staff is always ready to give an excellent service
minus^My room had too many things out of order... lights, phone, door knob, the shower licked out, television didn't turn on and when it did it didn't have cable signal... I reported it and mantenance was very prompted to fix it all... but I had to stay in the room for each person that had to fix each thing... I'd have been great to have an all working room all from the start.
minus^did not like shower opening into front door and was cold to get out no privacy also no room to put things by sink no counter space. Did not care for room
minus^30$ charge per room for early sign on. This is rediculous. I've been to many hotels in Vegas and it was waived. I stayed at MGM last year and it was waived. Service was poor. Front desk was rude which caused the additional 30 to be even more frustrating. Definitely will not stay here again.
plus^Hakkasan restaurant was good to have inside the Hotel.
minus^Even though our room was located at the non smoking floor, heavy smoke could be smelled at the bathroom because of the common ventilation hole between the floors.  My wife wanted to check in as I was out trying to return our rental car at the airport. The front desk did not accept my wifes request but when she insisted on because she was so tired, they gave us a very small room. After I went to the room, we had to pack everything again, go down to the front desk and argue about this. Only  after they gave us the room we reserved but this took our about 1 hour time and put lot of stress especially on my wife.
plus^The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed all of the restaurants and on-site amenities. Our room was very comfortable and we loved the jacuzzi tub in the spa suite! The express check-out in the lobby was also convenient.
minus^There was no coffeemaker in the room which was very surprising in a hotel of this standard, and it would have been nice to have a few more vegetarian options available on the room service menu.
minus^When we got to our non-smoking room there was a cigarette butt floating in the toilet, a disposable razor was on the floor under the T.V. and candy wrappers by the chair with candy on the floor. Told an employee at check in our concern about the cleanliness of the room and they said they would take care of it. Nobody came. At check out, they were not even concerned about their guest's visit. Don't even get me started on the omelette preparer at the Buffet! Very bad attitude!! 
plus^We loved the service we received when visiting the concierge and asking for assistance with show tickets, etc.  Our room was clean, comfortable, and quiet!  We loved being so close to so many attractions on the strip.  The David Copperfield show in the hotel was incredible!
minus^We didn't like the fact that smoking is permitted in the casino.
